1gd9l9c,2024-10-27T17:43:33,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

1e297nd,2024-07-13T17:55:58,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Hello, I'm 22F. (French)

I've been taking venlafaxine 150 mg since I was 16. Last year, I went abroad for a year and, due to a prescription error, I was forced to halve my dose for six months. The first few days were horrible, but I quickly got used to it.

When I returned to France, I decided to go back to 150 mg because the return was a bit difficult.
I started working in a hotel in December when the problems started. (I'd already been waking up sometimes with swelling in random places on my body for six months, but I blamed that on the humid climate.)

But this swelling persisted and came back with a vengeance. I sometimes wake up with a swollen hand, foot, finger, or eye.  I also sometimes have swelling on the soles of my feet, which makes it difficult to walk. It's also accompanied by severe hives all over my body (photo attached).

It's quite difficult psychologically, because no doctor has been able to help me, and only cortisone works. I scratch all day long, sometimes until I bleed. During severe attacks, the itching is so intense that I scratch with a brush or scissors.

Two weeks ago, I accidentally opened the venlafaxine leaflet and discovered that swelling and hives were listed as side effects. But the doctors don't think I've developed an allergy after years of treatment. After yet another appointment, the doctor put me back on 75 mg and increased my antihistamine dose.

So, that's been two or three weeks.  The first few days of withdrawal were excruciating, but it quickly calmed down. The hives and swelling are still there but have calmed down significantly.
But now, my mental state has been in freefall for a few days. I've rarely felt like this. I'm paranoid, I always have a lump in my stomach, I'm always on the verge of crying, I cry whenever I get the chance. I see everything in black.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to increase the dose because I'd like to get off this medication long-term, as I have too many other side effects (drowsiness, libido, electric shock in my brain, etc.). Incidentally, I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything like that. I just went there as a teenager for a feeling of unease (like all teenagers in the world, really), and they gave me a drastic treatment.  (I've since stopped taking anti-anxiety medications.)

Well, I'm not even sure if this phase where I'm not feeling well is due to withdrawal. So that's why I'd like to know your experiences with venlafaxine Effexor and antidepressant withdrawal in general.

1jl6lzy,2025-03-27T20:59:10,Does anyone get birthday depression?,"For the past ten years or so, I’ve hated my birthday. Usually I hate the build up to it too, I’d mostly forgotten about it this year and it’s my 24th today so I thought I’d finally escaped it but no. 
I don’t know what it is, whether it’s because I don’t really have a circle of friends who would ever want to go out (we generally do brunch with about 15-20 of us with the others in the group, I’m not close enough to them to be able to do it for myself), or whether it’s just getting older and feeling more and more unaccomplished. 
My mum is also not the easiest to be around, and will try to enforce plans which never end up happening anyway or end in an argument so I think I anticipate it happening every year (which it does, without fail). I don’t want this to come across as a pity party or as me being ungrateful, I’d honestly be far happier forgetting about it each year but there’s always an expectation to see my parents and siblings regardless of how much I don’t want to do anything. I just want to see if anyone feels the same, and how you deal with it because it wipes me out for a few weeks after as well.

All day (at work) I could feel this overwhelming sadness creeping in. 

I have so much going on in my personal life, and it was like as soon as I ended my run, and was on my cooldown, I fell apart. I haven’t cried like this in over 30 years. I post and show my vulnerability, (and my battles with mental health) not for attention, but to remind people that we are all humans, just trying to survive this thing called life. I want to remind everyone, that sadness is not weakness. Vulnerability is not weakness. It’s how we rise up, and fight through the dark times. Thats what shows us our strength. Battle your demons, and show them that you’re not going anywhere, but they are. We’ve got to be there for each other. Especially in these dark times.

1jhjsyn,2025-03-23T03:28:19,Nothing will last,"It’s crazy how often we trick ourselves into thinking that temporary setbacks define us.

If one person doesn’t love us, we assume nobody will. An employer doesn’t hire us, we think none of them will. When we get a bad grade, we believe that we are stupid. But in reality, everything shifts. The good, the bad, it all comes and goes.

I'm 22 years old and I study Software Engineering, the beginning of my depression started when my father started abusing me since I was 7 years old, I told my mom about it when I turned 18, if I'm honest with myself, I never made my mom proud during my whole life, it was something I always wanted to do, I'm not going to lie, I was making it or so I thought, since I started studying at my university I became more responsible, I learned to love myself more and focus on what's important.
My dad located me and beat me at the time of departure at my university, he broke my glasses.
To make matters worse, next week is my graduation, I have a failed course that I have to pay for or I won't be able to graduate as an engineer.
I'd rather slit my wrists right now than see my mom disappointed in me and have her tell me ""you're still the same irresponsible guy.""
This course is not even a course that I studied, the university forces you to look for a company and work without pay for 6 months, I couldn't get a company and now I'm screwed and without money to pay for that damn course :(
I have seen my mom cry many times and it has always broken my heart, I was always taught since I was little that a man should never cry, that doing that is faggy, for the first time in my life I am venting here, I am fucked and there is no solution for this, if you read this mom: ""I'm really sorry and i love You""

1jlj6tm,2025-03-28T06:37:43,"After almost 10 years of not being happy with how my life turned out, I feel like I've made no progress in my life and have very little willpower or strength to change.","I've been debating posting something here for a couple of years now, and I am finally taking the time to put my situation and feelings into words. I'm not the best at writing or explaining my feelings, so my story may be all over the place.

I'm miserable. I haven't been happy with how my life has been going since the start of high school. I was so bad at communicating in real life to the point where I was always trying to avoid starting a conversation with anyone. It astounds me that I was able to make a couple friends. I was constantly procrastinating and putting things off, whether it's schoolwork or my future. I barely went to school events or after-school activities, and spent most of my free time playing online games, keeping some sort of communication with my few friends.

When I finally got to college, nothing changed. In fact it got worse. I decided to pursue an engineering degree because I didn't know what else I was interested in and college applications were almost due. I started college during the pandemic, which may have been the loneliest time of my life. I had no roommate, no in person classes, and no friends. Since I had no synchronous classes, My sleep schedule pulled a 180 and I was eating my dinner when the food court opened at 6am. It got a little better the next year as an acquaintance from high school moved into my dorm, and we lived together until I graduated. I wouldn't call us close friends, but it was better than being alone. I realized I didn't want to be an engineer somewhere during my 3rd year, but felt like I owed it to my parents to graduate. So I continued. Throughout college, I've only met one person that I consider to be a friend that I made. Unfortunately I graduated around the time we started to hang out more, which really devastated me since I haven't made a friend since high school, and now I can't hang out with him since I lived out of state. When I graduated, I felt no pride or didn't feel like I achieved anything great. I don't feel like I took anything seriously enough and don't feel like I would be prepared for a job in the field, regardless of if I had good grades or not. My mom always said that college would be the best years of my life, and it pains me to think that I might have wasted it.

So now I'm home. It was at this point where I kind of self-destructed. I stopped eating and lost around 25 pounds in a couple months. I'm a big guy, maxed around 330, so maybe that's not too bad. I stopped playing video games, which was my life up until now. I now spend the majority of my life in bed with the lights off. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel comfortable in my own room anymore.

After reflecting on my life so far, I feel like my biggest mistake was not taking the time to find what I enjoy in life, and now that I'm at the time where I have to become independent, I feel like I will never have the chance. My social skills are still horrendous, I can't start a conversation with someone who doesn't have a similar interest. I can barely have a conversation even with my parents and I hate it. 

I love my parents. They always tried to do what was best for me and want me to succeed. After all the times they tell me they just want me to be happy, I can't help but feel miserable and guilty every time they bring up my situation. After all the opportunities they have given me, I still haven't made anything of my life, nor do I have a plan to.

3 Months after getting a degree in something I could care less about, and have made very little progress towards my future. I don't think I'll ever end it because I believe life goes on after I'm dead, and I can't do that to my family, but I just feel really lost right now. In my eyes, my future is being lonely and working a minimum wage job until I'm dead, and I'm ashamed that I don't have any bigger ambitions in life.

That's all I could think of. I'm not looking for pity, as I feel like I did this to myself. I'm looking for people who may have had a similar experience to me and how they managed to overcome it. This took me about 2 hours to write, but it feels nice to finally tell someone about it, rather than keeping it to myself. Feel free to ask questions.

1jlgi0m,2025-03-28T04:31:55,thank you to anyone who reads this,"I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. I wish I had friends to go out with, people who would give me courage and experience life with me so I wouldn’t be so nervous. I know I can only blame myself, but I’m just so upset. I wish things were different for me.

Today, my sister told me that my mom wanted to talk to me about something, but she acted weird about it, like she didn’t want to say what it was about even though i kinda already knew. When I went to see what my mom wanted and sat on the couch, she started talking about how i will need to do more chores/cleaning now that my sister would be working soon and wouldn’t be home much anymore because of high school, college courses, programs, and work. I already figured that would happen. It just makes sense.

But then my sister came downstairs and just stood there listening, even though, to my knowledge, my mom had only asked to speak to me. It made me uncomfortable. Then my mom started saying how I don’t do anything, how she works, how my sister does a lot, and then asked, “Do you think taking on more chores is too much for you?” Like… what? Of course not. But the way she says it, I just sit at home doing nothing, hurt. I know it’s true, and I hate it. Every day, I feel sad about it. Every night, I think about it. But when I try to express that, my mom just says I’m being defensive. The way she talks down to me makes me feel so small, and my younger sister just stood there listening. Then my mom said the conversation was for both of us, but everything she was saying was directed at me.

I always wanted to go to college. Ever since I was 15, I dreamed about it. I’d watch YouTube videos of freshmen sharing their experiences and think, maybe someday that’ll be me. But it wasn’t. I spent the last few years of my life inside my room.

I had so many dreams traveling with friends, going out on holidays and summer breaks, visiting cafes and malls together but none of it ever happened. I didn’t make it happen for myself. I wish I had someone to do it all with, someone to push me, and I’d push them too. It’s less scary when you’re not alone.

But a huge part of why I feel this way, why I have so much anxiety, is because of my weight. I’ve been insecure about it for as long as I can remember, but now it affects me more than ever. I don’t even like going places because I feel ashamed, like people are judging me. I feel like I can’t live unless I lose weight. I wanted to be that beautiful girl in college, the one with friends and a life, but I’m not. I know I’m too sensitive, I know I lack discipline, and I know I’m not strong enough for this world. Each year, I lose more hope and waste more time. I only see myself getting worse i don’t think i can keep doing this i don’t see a future for me.

I’m sorry if this is all over the place i just had to tell someone.",depression,feel like im going lose mind wish friends go people would give courage experience life wouldnt nervous know blame im upset wish things different today sister told mom wanted talk something acted weird like didnt want say even though kinda already knew went see mom wanted sat couch started talking need chorescleaning sister would working soon wouldnt home much anymore high school college courses programs work already figured would happen makes sense sister came downstairs stood listening even though knowledge mom asked speak made uncomfortable mom started saying dont anything works sister lot asked think taking chores much like course way says sit home nothing hurt know true hate every day feel sad every night think try express mom says im defensive way talks makes feel small younger sister stood listening mom said conversation us everything saying directed always wanted go college ever since dreamed id watch youtube videos freshmen sharing experiences think maybe someday thatll wasnt spent last years life inside room many dreams traveling friends going holidays summer breaks visiting cafes malls together none ever happened didnt make happen wish someone someone push id push less scary youre alone huge part feel way much anxiety weight ive insecure long remember affects ever dont even like going places feel ashamed like people judging feel like cant live unless lose weight wanted beautiful girl college one friends life im know im sensitive know lack discipline know im strong enough world year lose hope waste time see getting worse dont think keep dont see future im sorry place tell someone,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jlgi0m/thank_you_to_anyone_who_reads_this/,Neutral,Moderate Concern,us,39.7837304,-100.445882,1.0

I am only keeping up so I can finally finish high school and make mom proud, but after that I am done. It’s exhausting trying to fit into society as an autistic person with anxiety.
Keeping this bullshit up for years while trying and failing to make friends. I am truly done.


I really just need a gun to get this shit over with quick and easy.


How the fuck is an anxiety riddled mess like me supposed to go to university? It’s not possible. I am terrible at making friends and that especially in real life. It has ended up with them just being school friends and nothing more.


This is actually bullshit. I wish I were normal, but I am not so the only solution is to just hang myself I guess.
I can’t keep up with normal people. I wish I could remove my amygdala or at least the right hemisphere of it so I wouldn’t feel fear. 
Then again I would still be far from normal due to the autism.


I already told that motherfucker that I don’t do pills, why would I want to take that shit for the rest of my life?
I’ll end up a zombie.
I know my life is insignificant, and that especially compared to others. 
Still I will only push through to finish school and only then fuck off into the abyss.


I am not even mad at other people, I just wish I was normal and happy. 
Who the fuck thinks that this is harmony? 
I get what Durkheim was saying, but for the homeless individual themselves this was in no way good, which is why we should work as a society to fix these sorts of problems.
Not look at them and think “well shit dawg, I’m glad I’m not that guy. Good thing we have homeless people to set an example for the rest of us.”


I just realised that this might look like a word salad and honestly I don’t care. I needed to let this out.

1jgam82,2025-03-21T12:07:47,I hate myself and I hate everything,"Hello
I don’t know what’s the point of writing this and whether anyone is going to read it.
But I need to say it
I hate myself 
From a young age I knew I wasn’t attractive 
and people made sure I knew
I remember my father trying to cover my big forehead with my hair when I was 7
I remember him telling me to get inside and to stop playing with the girls because “you’re too old” when I was the youngest of the group.
I remember friends making fun of my looks in high school, “I’ve never seen a nose bigger than yours”
“Baldie” , “you have no eyelashes”

I remember my sister telling me I look like in my thirties when I was only 18
I remember when we were swimming and as my sister was taking pictures of us I asked her to only take a picture of me if I look good, she looked through the camera and said no you don’t look good. Her face looked very sorry 

I met someone a few months back, she mistook for my older sister who’s 15 years older than me.
And she actually said you look more like your older sisters 

I got married a few years ago and a few months after we got married my husband told me he didn’t find me attractive first but got used to it 
I cried so much after that and I kept crying every time I remember that
We don’t even have sex that often , even in our honeymoon and I know that that is because I’m ugly
I hate hime for that
I wish we didn’t get married 
But we have a baby now

My baby is really cute and im glad she is
I don’t want her to feel the way I felt my whole life
Some people commented on how cute she is and I asked does she look like me, all of them said Noo! 
It hurrtssss

I hate myself
I hate everything about me
Inside and outside 
I hate the way I think
How depressed i am

I don’t want my baby to grow up with a mother like me
I don’t know how to make it right 

I tried therapy for years. it didn’t work for me
I tried burying myself in work
I tried being positive and doing hobbies 
I tried everything 
Every thing

I don’t know what to do

I’m getting uglier by the year
I lost half of my already thin hair after having the baby
You could see my scalp from a million miles away

I gained 30 kgs

My body is covered in body acne and stretch marks
We barely have sex anymore 

Part of the reason is that i hate myself and don’t want my husband to look at my body 
And he doesn’t even initiate any form of intimacy that leads to that

I stopped taking care of myself because I have done that, and look where it led me.

Every night I go to sleep I pray I never wake up
Not because I’m ugly on the outside , but because it’s even worse in my head.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

1ji5iw1,2025-03-23T23:36:46,I can't stop feeling extremely anxious about death.,"Hey guys. I posted a couple days ago RE struggling with recurring panic attacks and nocturnal panic attacks. They have made me physically and mentally exhausted. My soul feels tired. They have also abruptly shook me to my core and made me come face to face with the fact that I am going to die. The panic attacks would come and my brain would say, ""you're going to drop dead."" And now that thought is on loop. It makes my head fuzzy. I do yoga, I eat well, I run, I live in nature, I tend to a garden, I get outside the house every day, I live with others, and none of its helping. I feel like my brain is inflamed or sick because the thoughts are so intrusive. I used to live my life in anticipation of the future, or thinking happy memories in the past, but it's like something shook me so strongly and reminded me that all we really have is now and that realization is sobering. I am grieving everything I have lost and will lose.

I keep thinking about how everyone I love will die. All the beautiful birds I watch every day, they will die. The opossum under my bird feeder at night will die. My precious cats will die. It makes me so anxious to the point where I am genuinely feeling ill 24/7 and I cannot go anywhere or do anything without this constant anxious panic about death.

I assume most humans think about mortality but it is making me depressed and sad. I have been a generally happy person and I love life, but I feel like I've been mentally hit with a weight that just won't lift. I am a lover of nature and environmentalist and have always found so much awe and beauty in nature but now when I look out at the trees or the creeks I just see my own reflection of sadness and the constant anxiety I've lived with my whole life.

Why do we have to die? It doesn't bring me peace knowing my atoms will dissipate, it makes me sick. All I know is right before me, and all I know will be stripped away into nothing. So what is the point? What are we doing here? It feels like a sick game, and humans have gone so far off the rails that everything in our society seems like it is just some unhealthy coping strategy. 

I look at strangers and think of how fleeting their existence is too. I think about all the terrible ways humans treat each other and the Earth and my heart is just so full of grief for the amount of suffering I am witnessing. I literally cannot even look at lobster tanks in the grocery store without wanting to bawl my eyes out. The worst part is that death is starting to sound peaceful because at least I won't have to think. But I love thinking and I don't want to die. I keep imaging myself screaming and crawling during my final days and all I see is terror. It makes me think about the blackness after death. We don't even experience death. What if its because of the sheer terror of it all? Ugh. It makes me sick.

I am only 28 and I want to live a long and happy life, but this is by far the hardest experience in my life I've had to go through. I'm just so sad. I am crying all the time over my own death and the death of us all. I have isolated myself from society and I know that doesn't help. Is this just depression? Anxiety? PTSD? A mix of it all?",anxiety,hey guys posted couple days ago struggling recurring panic attacks nocturnal panic attacks made physically mentally exhausted soul feels tired also abruptly shook core made come face face fact going die panic attacks would come brain would say youre going drop dead thought loop makes head fuzzy yoga eat well run live nature tend garden get outside house every day live others none helping feel like brain inflamed sick thoughts intrusive used live life anticipation future thinking happy memories past like something shook strongly reminded really realization sobering grieving everything lost lose keep thinking everyone love die beautiful birds watch every day die opossum bird feeder night die precious cats die makes anxious point genuinely feeling ill cannot go anywhere anything without constant anxious panic death assume humans think mortality making depressed sad generally happy person love life feel like ive mentally hit weight wont lift lover nature environmentalist always found much awe beauty nature look trees creeks see reflection sadness constant anxiety ive lived whole life die doesnt bring peace knowing atoms dissipate makes sick know right know stripped away nothing point feels like sick game humans gone far rails everything society seems like unhealthy coping strategy look strangers think fleeting existence think terrible ways humans treat earth heart full grief amount suffering witnessing literally cannot even look lobster tanks grocery store without wanting bawl eyes worst part death starting sound peaceful least wont think love thinking dont want die keep imaging screaming crawling final days see terror makes think blackness death dont even experience death sheer terror ugh makes sick want live long happy life far hardest experience life ive go im sad crying time death death us isolated society know doesnt help depression anxiety ptsd mix,26,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ji5iw1/i_cant_stop_feeling_extremely_anxious_about_death/,Neutral,High Risk,us,39.7837304,-100.445882,1.0
1jiyqql,2025-03-25T00:30:09,Going to the dentist for the first time in over 10 years tomorrow and I'm scared of being judged,"Scared and embarrassed of my oral hygiene. Especially embarassed because there is free health care here in Germany and I should have gone to a dentist sooner. They will find out that I never brushed and took care of my teeth, did nothing in all those years without seeing a dentist. I'm only now seeking a dentist because of an abcess/infection of a tooth that broke off YEARS ago, which could kill me now. Not only that, I have 1 more definite cavity, worn yellow teeth, small dark spots, 2 emerging wisdom teeth and so many issues in my mouth. Already imagining them listing all the issues I have makes me feel ashamed...And what if they ask me so many questions of why I didn't go sooner, what if they judge or scold me and stuff.   
I'm also scared to get my tooth pulled or that I'd need to go to the hospital in case the infection spread too deep into my bones,   
Plus the social anxiety... I really do not anticipate tomorrow :(

1jjstqj,2025-03-26T01:34:07,Anxiety from change,"
Does anyone else get crippling anxiety from changes? 

Here’s my story. In 2022 my boyfriend and I were planning a move to a new state so that he could attend school. I lived and have always lived in my little home town and have also never lived with a significant other.. while my boyfriend and I were living together at the time, it was with his parents - so it’s different. About 2 months prior to the move, we visited some family in another state and attended a wine tasting as a going away gift for my boyfriend. That night was the first night I had ever experienced anxiety. When I went to bed, I started to get a stomach ache and had to use the restroom.. now normally, wine and beer doesn’t sit well with my stomach so I wasn’t too shocked that this was happening. But then I started to panic, I felt a burning sensation throughout my whole body, I couldn’t stop twitching, and didn’t feel real. It was the most bizarre feeling. I eventually fell asleep and the next day was better. However, slowly and slowly it started showing itself at certain times. The second time I got it was 2 months later when we went on a camping trip (this was about a week before we were planning to drive a Uhaul to our new place in a new state and move all of our stuff in). During our camping trip I was totally fine, up until I realized that I wasn’t experiencing the anxiety (side bar: I didn’t know it was anxiety yet, I thought maybe it was wine, or sugar, or caffeine). The second I checked in with myself to see how I was feeling, I got the stomach ache and out of body feeling and had to go to bed immediately. 

I started to think that this was all happening because I was making a big move and that it’ll all stop when I get settled into our new home in our new state, but it hasn’t gone away. I only ever get the anxiety if I am traveling or if people are visiting. I will get small sensations of it when I do new things, like go to concerts, meet new people, or anything outside of my normal routine.. but that usually stops after I do whatever the event or occasion is and it won’t happen the next time. It however has not gone away for when I travel or have people visit me. 

I’m not afraid of flying, I’m afraid of getting anxiety and being stuck on a plane. I am also not afraid of people, I am afraid of getting anxiety and being stuck somewhere that I can’t calm down. 

About a year ago my boyfriend and I got a cat and I was so anxious when he came home. I wanted to get rid of him for the first week, but I eventually got used to it and now I love him so much. 

My boyfriend proposed to me in November of 2024 and I felt slightly anxious after that and shamefully wanted to go back in time and not deal with the engagement, because I hated the anxiety. That eventually subsided and now I’m so happy.

After that I started avoiding wedding planning because I didn’t want to deal with the anxiety that comes with it. I noticed that I’m doing things to avoid getting anxiety, so I decided that I wanted to do a mini elopement. I decided that we would do a small wedding the same weekend that my fiancé was graduating since everyone would be in town already. So I put the plan in action and sent out invites to everyone (he is graduating in May of this year so it’d be 2 months away). To give an overview of where I was at a week ago, I was planning on trying for a baby, planning a wedding, and we had some changes coming up in the next two months with him graduating and us moving back home.. a lot of exciting things! But, the night I sent the invites out.. I was hit with the absolute worst anxiety of my life. I was down for 5 days, feeling absolutely horrible. I couldn’t get out of the fight of flight feeling and was an absolute wreck. It resulted in me canceling the wedding and deciding it was just too much for me to handle. I also had put a hold on trying for baby. 

I always thought that the anxiety was due to traveling and social events, but when I got the anxiety just from being at home, I started to think I was going insane and my mind was giving up on me. However now, I’m realizing it’s due to life changes or pretty much doing anything outside of my ordinary routine. 

Does this happen to anyone else? I am feeling better knowing that there may be a root cause to all of this, but I also feel so alone in my thoughts. I’ve started to feel like my life is over.. I feel like I can never have kids because I’m scared of getting anxiety and not being able to change my mind once I have them (depressing and morbid, I know). I feel like I won’t be able to have the wedding I want because I’m scared of the anxiety. I have all of these fears and feel lost. I’m really just looking for people who can relate to my story. Does it ever get better?

1jjsov9,2025-03-26T01:28:49,I just wanna feel normal again :(,"Hello everybody, before I share anything else, I should mention some context of my anxiety. I had my first ever anxiety attack last summer, and that was under the influence of cannabis (first experience). After sleeping it off, I was just fine. 

Fast forward 6-7 months (right after new years), I had another attack, this time I was sober, and had only one thing that may have caused it. I have been on and off with my ex, and at the time of the attack, it was the 1 month mark of us having no contact, and earlier on in the day I was extremely sad about it. However, during the time of the attack, I wasn’t thinking about her or thinking about anything at all. I know that stressful thoughts can build up subconsciously in the back of your mind, but ever since this first attack, I haven’t been normal, and I really just want to feel like myself again. 

It’s been around 4 months since my first attack, and I honestly haven’t had an anxiety/panic attack in over a month now, but my body seems to react to it differently. Instead of being okay for a certain amount of time, and then occasionally have anxiety attacks (like the majority of people do), I DONT really have anxiety attacks, as I’m able to control them before they get to me too bad. Although I don’t really have anxiety attacks anymore, my everyday life is affected, from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I seem to constantly be in a fight/flight mode where I think I’m going to die, when I literally have myself convinced that I’m okay. 

Throughout the day, I have a variety of different feelings that completely change how I act. Recently, I’ve had the same vision feeling where my eyes can’t seem to relax, along with my mind constantly running. I don’t really know how to explain it, but this feeling is one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced, and on top of that, it’s affecting my sleep schedule, as it takes hours to even fall asleep. 

I should mention that I have tried therapy. Unfortunately, it made things worse for me because when I focus on my anxiety (such as talking about it), I can’t stop thinking about it, which leads to that fight/flight mode, vision feeling, etc. Also, I feel like nothing is real, “dissociation” is what people call it I believe. Additionally, I’ve been on multiple different medications, such as Xanax, buspar, hydroxyzine, and another one I don’t remember the name of. Currently I’m on bupropion, it’s been around 3 1/2-4 weeks and I notice no significant changes in my anxiety. If anybody can help me feel like I’m not alone, or try suggesting some things, please do. Thank you very much :)",anxiety,hello everybody share anything else mention context anxiety first ever anxiety attack last summer influence cannabis first experience sleeping fine fast forward months right new years another attack time sober one thing may caused ex time attack month mark us contact earlier day extremely sad however time attack wasnt thinking thinking anything know stressful thoughts build subconsciously back mind ever since first attack havent normal really want feel like around months since first attack honestly havent anxietypanic attack month body seems react differently instead okay certain amount time occasionally anxiety attacks like majority people dont really anxiety attacks im able control get bad although dont really anxiety attacks anymore everyday life affected time wake time go sleep seem constantly fightflight mode think im going die literally convinced im okay throughout day variety different feelings completely change act recently ive vision feeling eyes cant seem relax along mind constantly running dont really know explain feeling one uncomfortable things ive ever experienced top affecting sleep schedule takes hours even fall asleep mention tried therapy unfortunately made things worse focus anxiety talking cant stop thinking leads fightflight mode vision feeling etc also feel like nothing real dissociation people call believe additionally ive multiple different medications xanax buspar hydroxyzine another one dont remember name currently im bupropion around weeks notice significant changes anxiety anybody help feel like im alone try suggesting things please thank much,8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jjsov9/i_just_wanna_feel_normal_again/,Positive,Moderate Concern,us,39.7837304,-100.445882,1.0

1jk4xfx,2025-03-26T11:20:57,My Life Is In Ruins,"Let me just start off by saying that my now ex girlfriend/baby mama (31F), and I (34M) are cocaine addicts. It has completely destroyed our lives.

I've been using for about 4 years, and she has been using for about 12 years. The last 2 have been the worst of my life.

I started to lose control when my grandma's (the woman that raised me) health started to decline severely. When she died 2 years ago, I went into a grief spiral, and completely nuked everything.

The following is what I've been through in just the last year alone:

-5 pinks slips
-3 job firings
-2 break ups w/ my baby mama (yesterday was the second time)
-1 accidental cocaine overdose
-1 fetty lace overdose
-1 apartment eviction
-2 inpatient rehabs
-1 sober living (Got kicked out for relapsing)

I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I hate it. So much. It has taken nearly everything from me. In the last 24 hours, it has cost me my job, and my relationship.

She was everything to me. I fought so fucking hard for her. Harder than I've ever fought for anyone, including myself. She was my person. My soulmate.

The drugs changed us both. It stole our attention away from everything that mattered. We were best friends, partners, and lovers.

I have gotten better with my usage, but her's has gotten so much worse. It's taking her mental health to extremely dangerous places. We are both toxic individuals, and it's worse in our relationship. We both just keep triggering and enabling each other.

I hope that one day we will get sober and healthy, and we'll have a chance to try again. Staying together now will only hurt or kill each other.

I'm trying to focus on myself and my sons, but it's still fresh. If not being with me saves her life, then I will gladly sacrifice what I want. This is hard. She was the love of my life. The only woman that ever made me feel seen, heard, and understood. She made me feel unconditionally loved.

I know I have to let her go to save us both, but I love her so fucking much. Things have to get better from here. This is my last chance to save myself.

1jhwrpd,2025-03-23T16:31:21,"Everybody wants to wear their recovery like a badge of honor, yet so few are willing to represent themselves as the addict still stuck in addiction","Here's what I find funny ... Is so few are ever willing to share about their addiction WHILE they're in addiction. I can guess why ... But why not? I do. I'll say straight up it's meth, too. If that's the condition I'm in, that's the condition I'm in. Such is life ... 



Some of us find ourselves depressed some days, happy other days, in the hospital some others days, or flat on our face naked in the middle of the street some others. Maybe at that point we're dead. If that's the condition we're in ... That's the condition we're in. Again ... Such is life.


I don't expect everyone to think this deeply and keep perspective, but we are on a ball floating through a vast billions of years old universe. I don't know who decided I was shit for a human because I struggle with ADDICTION, but, as you could probably guess, maybe some people need a better understanding of what that is, if you feel so inclined, or want to paint them a picture so they'll have a better impression of you. Fact is our brains have found something it believes is worthy of using to cope. It doesn't see the consequences of using it ... That takes the thinking part of our brain to figure out, right? It just knows this right here drug produces lots of dopamine and to remember it, so as to motivate me to return to it. 



But, ya know, *I'm* personally not so worried about people's petty judgements. I struggle with methamphetamine use disorder. I'm a meth addict. A chemsex addict, in fact. I'm an imperfect, messy, emotional creature just like everybody else. And I still have worth like everybody else. I'm a complex human being like everybody else. 




My meth use says the same thing smoking weed, drinking alcohol, smoking cigs, popping pills and doing psychedelics says about someone -- nothing. So they can go on and judge like it does, but I'm perfectly secure in who I am and who I wanna be, and can show a respect for people and their complexities.



Seems to me the reason a lot of people talk about being in recovery is because they enjoy wearing it as a badge of honor. That's cool. But I'm here to say I'm still in the madness, and that's ok too. I'm deserving of the same amount of basic respect as anyone else, and maybe I'll get my hard earned break someday as well. But just because I still struggle doesn't mean I should have to hide while I do, as though addiction were something to be ashamed of.

1jgvfpz,2025-03-22T05:31:39,Crack addiction graph,"

Hello,

Since the first day I smoked Crack ( Two years ago), it became a daily habit. There wasn’t a build-up, it just started and kept going. I lost a lot of money and became underweight. I dropped from 66 to 46 kilograms without even realizing it at first. I was working from home, which only made things worse. Even though my job required focus and mental sharpness, I still managed to get things done. Always last minute, somehow, but done. And that’s part of what made it dangerous. I could still perform. I could still deliver. So I kept lying to myself.

What I’ve learned is that no matter how smart I think I am, Crack is the way to hell. It doesn’t care how clever you are, how much potential you have, or how much you tell yourself you’re in control. It strips you down to nothing.

I managed to stop for a few days sometimes, but once I start again, I can’t stop. Especially with the person I was hanging out with. We were living together. I was the one who smoked it first, then we smoked together the next day. After that, it was part of the routine. Day after day.

We had a lot of problems. I was paying for everything. He couldn’t stop, not even for one day. He started acting differently. Lying constantly. The only thing he cared about was Crack. He was older than me by ten years, but I ended up being the one who took care of everything. Rent, food, damage control. It became chaos. And even though I could see it clearly, I stayed. I thought I was strong enough to handle it. I thought I could carry both of us.

I tried keeping my distance. Sometimes we would stop talking, or I would pull away, but it never lasted. We kept ending up back together. Not out of love or hope, but out of habit, out of guilt, out of that strange sense of responsibility I couldn’t explain.

Eventually, I decided to leave the city. I quit my job. Left everything behind. I spent the last six months far away. During that time, I started to feel like myself again. I ate properly, slept, and gained back over 15 kilograms. I looked healthier. I felt clearer. I thought I was done with that chapter.

But earlier this month, I came back. We saw each other again. And yes, we smoked a few times.

This time, it felt different. I didn’t even get high. All I felt was anxiety. A tight chest. Physical panic. There was no pleasure in it anymore. No illusion of escape. Just a harsh reminder that this thing still had a grip on me. And the worst part is, I already suffer from depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Crack makes all of that worse. It amplifies everything I try to manage. It replaces the high with a storm.

I don’t have trouble staying away from him now. I’m not attached in the same way I used to be. But I still worry about him. I still get thoughts like, “What if something happens to him?” Even though he did unforgivable things. Even though everyone tells me he’s just using me, that he talks badly about me, that he’s only ever taken and never given. Maybe they’re right. But I don’t hate him. I don’t love him either. I feel something in between. More like grief. not even grief for him, but for who I was around him I don't know maybe GUILT. I kept trying to be someone who could hold everything together. Someone who could fix what wasn’t theirs to fix.

I’ve always been assertive. Direct. But even with that, I’ve realized something uncomfortable. I might be too good to be true. I care too much. I give too much. Even when it’s breaking me.

I’ve started looking for a new job again. It’s been two weeks now. I’m trying to rebuild slowly, and I don’t want to fall back into what it was. I want to get back the life I had before I let all of this take over. But I know that the real recovery isn’t just physical or professional. It’s inside. It’s learning how to care without erasing yourself in the process.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking here. Maybe nothing. Maybe I just needed to write this. Maybe you’ve been there. Maybe you understand what I mean when I say that the drug isn’t even the hardest part. It’s the role you play around it. The version of yourself you become to survive it.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. I’ve been staring at this graph I made to track usage. It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than data. But now when I look at it, it feels like a journal. Like a confession. Every spike, every drop, it doesn’t just show how much I smoked. It shows when I started to disappear.

1jkrlhb,2025-03-27T06:12:58,"Currently in rehab, need advice.","I am currently mandated to six months of rehab by my drug court. Yesterday, the program co-director told me that because I was doing so good, that they would talk to my legals and see if I could leave early in a couple weeks and go to a halfway house for the last three months of my mandate. 

I am currently on 24mg of Suboxone, and have been trying to get the nurse and doctors to either get me off Suboxone or to switch me to something else instead, because Suboxone no longer does anything to prevent urges after taking it for six months. They've refused at every time, and if I decide not to take it for a day or two, they flip out on me and send emails to my counselor, so I feel forced to take it daily. Eventually, I would take it and then just hold onto it until night-time and take it then, because I don't like how it makes me feel during the day because I have to go to groups. When I first took Suboxone, it was great, I had absolutely no cravings whatsoever, but after being on it for so long, it just doesn't help with that anymore.

Today, the nurse caught me trying to cheek it until night. I got told that they were kicking me off the MAT program and to not come down in the morning for it anymore. I thought whatever, no big deal. 

I get called down to the directors office today at three, and she accuses me of selling my medication to other clients, and said that she remembered that I was in her office once before begging her for another chance and that she gave it to me and now it bit her in the ass. That is a lie. I never ever have gotten in trouble here before, and I've never even been in her office before. Like I said, just yesterday they said that I was doing so good that I might be able to leave early. Now she is reporting to my legals that I am selling medication and that I am being discharged from the program, she is transferring me to a sister program in the same company of Samaritan Village.

After this happened, the nurse told every single client that came to the window to get meds that I was caught cheeking my Suboxone and she told everyone who would listen that I'm being kicked out. She told the director and every client that went to the window that she's caught me three times now, which is also not true, this is the first and only time I've been caught doing it. 

So my questions are; 

1. Is it legal for them to just cold turkey me off of medication that will give me withdrawal? 

2. Is it legal for the nurse to go around violating HIPPA laws by disclosing to clients what I take and bragging that she caught me? 

3. Is there anything I can do, like maybe call oasis, to get this rectified? Should I try calling my legals and explain what happened? 

I'm sure I have more questions but I'm tired and stressed and that's all that currently comes to mind. Any and all advice is welcomed, thank you all for your time and support.

cz6nfd,2019-09-03T21:19:51,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

1jheoa5,2025-03-22T23:38:58,Everyone telling you not to die is a F Hypocrite,"I came to this sub reddit because I always feel I want to die, life is too hard and nobody helps you, even worse they have the audacity to tell you that ending it all is cowardice, wrong, to think about everyone else around you, that its not the answer, that there are other solutions, but in the end they just dont want to feel bad themeselves, they dont care about you no matter what they say, they will even lie if it means you don die, do you even get that we are in pain mfs, and you are doing nothing to help, when all we have left is the hope that ending it all is an actual option, you come and take that from us too, I think more people end up dying from the desperation of having no actual options and people ignoring and invalidating their pain, than from actual suicidal thoughts. It would be better if someone acknowledged that your life is a living hell, than telling you that you should just ""keep on living"". Like why, who am I living for, why am i perpetuating the pain, for some rando who just wants to feel good with himself because he ""stopped"" someone from finally getting his deserved rest from life and people. Just a bunch of self serving hipocrites, want to help someone whos suicidal? Involve yourself in his life, feel his pain, actually FEEL the hell he is going through see if at the end you can keep saying the same bs about dying not being the answer.

She was supposed to get up on her legs after the anesthesia wore off, but she didn't, she passed the whole afternoon and evening on her bed, refusing even to drink.

She is the only reason I have to keep on going, and now even this reason is coming to an end. By tomorrow, I'll be alone, in a place that I hate, surrounded by people I don't like and with no way out.

If I'm on the side of the living by next week, I'll update this post.

So long.



UPDATE: This morning she has been a bit more reactive: she sat, ate and drank (but I had to bring food and water to her) something. With a bit of encouragement and a bit of help she also walked outside and did all her stuff on her own.

I've just came back from the vet and he said that she's... fine, and that he doesn't want to change my mind but that he wouldn't suggest me to euthanize her considering her current conditions, so she's still with me. This evening I'll go to another vet for an ecodoppler to confirm if she has cancer and then we'll decide if putting her down there or giving her some meds to let her live a long as she's willing to fight.



UPDATE 2: Just came out from the veterinarian: she has a cancer of 2,5cm of diameter on her heart. The prognosis is that thinking she'll live another month is hugely optimistic, she will die in probably less than a week from one of these three possible outcomes: 1) the cancer starts spilling blood in her myocardium once again and I'll have to put her down. 2) the cancer starts spilling blood in her myocardium once again, cause a stroke (her heart is very weak right now) and she'll go away gently and with no stress. 3) Her heart fails on its own, she dies gently and with no stress.

1jkivjw,2025-03-26T23:58:38,My therapist gave me the ick...,"Some background... I have a ton of trauma from the lifestyle I lived for the last 10 years. I was an addict and I was a pretty big drug dealer working for some pretty bad people. Not my proudest moment and getting arrested saved my life and I got sober. I have been sober for over 2 years now. So I went to my second therapist after trying therapy in January. 

The first one instilled doubt in me when she asked me questions that were not necessary to treating me for trauma. It made me think that she was a cop and I almost shut down... She was asking me about things like if I transported drugs over state lines and if I ever went to Mexico and stuff that was unnecessary. So since the seed of doubt was planted I switched therapists. 

The next therapist was a man and I've seen him 3 times as of today. My initial intake and 2 sessions. At our first meeting he was saying that I ""had a unique look, meaning my skin tone was nice""... Weird but ok. 

At our second session he said ""no disrespect but you are an attractive woman. I've had other light skinned women that were attractive that had low self esteem and I couldn't understand why they thought this way"". This was right after he asked me about my past relationships and which ones had been healthy. Meaning no abuse (physical, mental or psychological) and where no drugs were involved. To which I responded zero. 

The. He of course said I have a lot, a lot of trauma and I was like, well duh!! Then he was saying I need to ""completely surrender"" so that he could help me and that after the other statement made me kinda get the ick. 

As we finished up the session he said ""next session I want to talk about just you so I can get to know you as a person."" I left that appointment feeling really weird and not really wanting to go back.

Am I being too picky or am I justified, for a lack of better word, in wanting to change again.

1jj9b3v,2025-03-25T08:07:36,At a crossroad.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. We've been married for 22 years, together for a lot longer than that with three kids, two in high school and one in college.

 I got a text from the sheriff's department asking me to call them and then a flood of texts from the neighbors asking me what was going on.  I knew my daughter was at home alone and feared the worst.  I spoke with the sheriff, and he said they were taking her to the emergency room, and I immediately left a meeting and met her there.  My wife was in-flight on her way to visit my mother-in-law, oldest daughter, and her sister who traveled out there with her.  She received the same texts from the neighbors and was frantic so I tried to keep her updated as best I could on the way to the ED.  After a long wait I was able to see her and thankfully she was fine physically but was referred to an inpatient mental health facility. 
 
I agreed and headed that way to fill out paperwork and get her checked in.  My wife wanted to fly back but I told her to stay out there as it was important to spend time with everybody (her Mom has serious health issues), that visiting hours were limited, and that I would take care of things at home.
I visited my daughter at every opportunity at the facility, dealt with the billing, paperwork, appointments and everything else while keeping my wife updated several times daily.  I reached out to my daughter’s boss, school, and her performance group to let them know she was hospitalized and keep them updated.

My wife was unsure about staying out there, but I assured her I had things under control and to spend quality time with the rest of the family, but I did warn her I would need time to decompress once she got back.
I adjusted my work schedule so I could drop off and pick up my son every day and spend as much time as possible with him between doctors’ appointments, visits with my daughter, and work.   We cooked dinners together, watched movies, and cleaned up the house so my wife and daughter would come home to comfort.

After about a week my daughter was discharged, and I brought her home.  My wife was flying back that night, so I got her car washed as she mentioned it being particularly dirty before she left.  We all went to pick her up at the airport and had an emotional reunion.  
We set up appointments for family and individual therapy and while there is still a long journey ahead, my daughter is headed in the right direction.  
I was supposed to go out of town for a boys’ weekend at a lake and while I felt it would be good for my mental health; I felt it best to stay home and spend time together as a family.  

Saturday morning, I woke up early to feed and let out the dog and noticed that she had gotten into the trash and spread it throughout the first floor of the house.  I cleaned it up, laid down on the couch to watch TV and dozed off.  I woke to my wife asking me if my son and I had spoken about quitting Muay Thai as we had missed it, it was expensive, and he had expressed to her he didn’t want to go any more (keep in mind we started going together at his request).  I was mildly annoyed as there was no hello or good morning, just pointed questions, but we agreed to cancel it going forward and I let it go.
Later we were all hanging out in the family room and she mentioned she had been looking at new light fixtures for the house.  I expressed surprise because we had been discussing getting a new dining room set and asked “I thought you wanted a new dining room set?”.  She said she wanted the dining set, the lights and a lot more.  For background, I handle our long-term finances, and she handles the short-term.  We have been discussing home upgrades for some time, but she felt we couldn’t afford them.  I told her let’s make a list and prioritize them.  I chose a new cooktop and hood as ours wasn’t working correctly which aggravated me daily as I do most of the cooking.  She wanted a new dining room set.  She didn’t think we could afford both and I told her we could tap into long term funds whether that was via loans or selling stock.  I moved forward on the cooktop and she was going to pick out and order the dining room set.  She wasn’t convinced we could afford what she wanted and pointed out that I was going on a snowboard trip that I had been planning for a year.  I told her I would skip the trip if that made her more comfortable ordering the dining room set she wanted.  I was willing to sacrifice something important to me for something important to her, so when she mentioned the lights and more I was thrown off because I had sacrificed something important to me and the dining room set didn’t seem important to her anymore, and I didn’t understand.  We discussed it further and while I didn’t raise my voice I am sure my aggravation and surprise came through.  She burst into tears and went upstairs.

She stayed in our room the rest of the day except for coming down briefly for dinner.  I tried to engage with her but she didn’t seem interested.  Later a neighbor invited us over to their house for drinks and board games but when I asked if she wanted to go she declined.  I ended up falling asleep early on the couch.  The next morning I received the following text – “I’m leaving for a little bit.  When I get back I think we need to have a discussion about our future.  This isn’t it”.

I immediately went to speak with her and she told me that she didn’t feel I support her and implied we should end things.  I told her my side of the story and then left to go for a drive to clear my head.  

I am not perfect by any means and have many things I could handle better, but I am a good father and husband.  I love my wife but feel like I am at my wit’s end.  I could not have been more supportive for everybody in my family during one of the worst periods in our lives and then to be told I am not being supportive and threatened with divorce is heartbreaking.  I told her I need time to decompress but felt attacked and then no concern for my feelings.

I know everyone is under stress and I am trying to give grace, but I need support, too.  The last time I needed support was when I was caring for my Mom full-time through a divorce complicated by dementia, which eventually led to an ALS diagnosis and eventually her passing all in the middle of Covid.  During this time my wife was cold, distant, and said “she needed some space”.  The two times that I truly needed support in our marriage not only did I not get it, but it felt like a heavier burden was placed on me.

We work well together as parents and have built a good life for ourselves financially, but I’ve felt for some time that I am putting more effort into us than she is.  Our plan was for the kids to graduate high school, we would retire early, and travel the world, but it’s tough to see now.

We’ve tried marriage counseling in the past and while I saw value in it, she didn’t and the last time I brought it up she said, “the counselor looked at me like I was crazy and that’s probably what you wanted”.  After a moment of stunned silence, I told her “no, I want you to be happy, I want us to be happy”.

My plan is to continue to focus on my daughter and the other kids to get us through this crisis but put less effort into the relationship.  I’ve come to the realization I can’t make her happy if she doesn’t put an effort into making herself happy.  While I hope for her and the kids’ sake she finds happiness, I suspect once I am removed from the situation, she’ll still be unhappy and realize what could’ve been.  It sucks that I can’t retire soon as planned and will have to start over again.  All I know is I can’t do this anymore.

We plan to continue family counseling, and I am considering individual counseling again despite my last counselor ghosting me.  I suspect it was because on the surface I would appear self-aware but I still felt value in expressing my feelings.  Apparently my wife could hear my conversations from the level below and said I wasn’t opening up to him. I didn’t find that out until after the fact, not sure how I feel about that.   Anyway, not sure if I am asking for advice or just trying to get it off my chest at this point.

1jhx9as,2025-03-23T17:04:30,I’ve never told my girlfriend the reason I stopped going to the gym is because I like it when other women look at me. I don’t know if I should tell her now.,"So I've been struggling in my relationship for a while. I've been seeing my therapist since about September, mainly because I have communication issues but now it feels amazing to be able to articulate my feelings out loud.

For the past year or two we've been having sexual incompatibility issues. Sometimes she says it's because she wonders if she's asexual, sometimes she says it's because I'm not attentive enough, one time she said she wasn't finishing, but I get a new answer every time I ask how to improve things. She says she wants consistency from me, says she feels like one day I'm going to wake up and just leave her and she's afraid that every day will be that day.

I've tried to remain consistent. I've tried working with her to accommodate her needs and feeling but I feel like it's never enough. When I try to remain consistent she says I'm love bombing her, when I stop trying she says it causes her to panic. She asks me to text her how I'm feeling but whenever I do it devolves into an argument where she's yelling and then either I shut down or she shuts down.

I just want to feel desires. I stopped going to the gym consistently because, while living at my previous building, I'd always see this girl walking her dog and checking me out. Normally I'd chalk it up to me just wilding, because who would want me(?), but as I've grown in my career and as a person I've learned a lot of women do want a guy like me. I'm actually desirable.

I stopped going because I felt like I wanted that at home, that if I worked with her and focused on us then I wouldn't need that kind of validation. My desire has only grown. I want to feel wanted. I want to feel loved. I want to come home to someone who still thinks I'm hot. 

We've talked and she says things are getting better but I'm becoming resentful because I don't see her changing at all. I've asked her to see a personal therapist and she's done virtually nothing on that end (but I forgive her because I think of how many years I fought off the idea too). We saw a couples therapist once but now she gets upset (body language wise) when I mention it again because the time we tried she said she hasn't had an orgasm with me and I shut down because I'd been begging her to tell me what was wrong and what she needed in our sex life. 

I feel like she hasn't forgiven me for it. I mean what was I even supposed to say? ""You faked it pretty well."", ""Why didn't you tell me that when I asked you time and time again what you need from me?"", ""Why am I just hearing this now?"", ""You won't even make yourself orgasm yet you expect me to do it?"", ""Maybe if you get your nose out of a book and actually try to HELP me then maybe just maybe we could solve this but you're so set on avoiding failure that you'd rather I look like an A-hole!"".

I've gained about 17 pounds since we met, technically it's healthy because I was underweight, but now I look at myself in the mirror and I think ""What if she doesn't want you because she's disgusted by you? What if it's the man boobs? The jelly rolls? The lack of abs?"" and I want to just cry sometimes. I want to try going back but I'm terrified I'll fall in love with the first person who looks at me with an ounce of desire.

I'm terrified that my coworker is right and I am actually attractive. I'm afraid that I'm right too. I'm afraid that if I get back down to my low weight she's going to want me again and if we do break up I'll never be able to get back to this point. I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm 25, unhappy and all I want is to be able to cry in her arms and tell her to help me! I want to tell her I'm struggling and that I don't want to marry her until she's worked on her sex drive or helped me understand her better or helped me figure out what she needs.

I want to tell her she's selfish for not getting help while knowing I'm struggling. I want to tell her that she's every bit as bad as she thinks she is because she's creating a self fulfilling prophecy. I want her to tell me that she's every bit doesn't want this anymore or get help or tell me what I can do to help her.

I can't marry her or rather I can but I know I can't have kids with her. It's bad now but I know that I'll collapse in on myself if we have kids and she uses them as an excuse to never have sex again. I say collapse because I know I won't cheat, I can't do it. It's not because I love her too much or because I'm selfless or cheating is wrong. I can't do it because it would break a part of me that I want to keep, a part of me that's a dreamer and believes in hope.

I can't tell if I'm venting or want advice anymore. I'm just in need of help.",therapy,ive struggling relationship ive seeing therapist since september mainly communication issues feels amazing able articulate feelings loud past year two weve sexual incompatibility issues sometimes says wonders shes asexual sometimes says im attentive enough one time said wasnt finishing get new answer every time ask improve things says wants consistency says feels like one day im going wake leave shes afraid every day day ive tried remain consistent ive tried working accommodate needs feeling feel like never enough try remain consistent says im love bombing stop trying says causes panic asks text im feeling whenever devolves argument shes yelling either shut shuts want feel desires stopped going gym consistently living previous building id always see girl walking dog checking normally id chalk wilding would want ive grown career person ive learned lot women want guy like im actually desirable stopped going felt like wanted home worked focused us wouldnt need kind validation desire grown want feel wanted want feel loved want come home someone still thinks im hot weve talked says things getting better im becoming resentful dont see changing ive asked see personal therapist shes done virtually nothing end forgive think many years fought idea saw couples therapist gets upset body language wise mention time tried said hasnt orgasm shut id begging tell wrong needed sex life feel like hasnt forgiven mean even supposed say faked pretty well didnt tell asked time time need hearing wont even make orgasm yet expect maybe get nose book actually try help maybe maybe could solve youre set avoiding failure youd rather look like ahole ive gained pounds since met technically healthy underweight look mirror think doesnt want shes disgusted man boobs jelly rolls lack abs want cry sometimes want try going back im terrified ill fall love first person looks ounce desire im terrified coworker right actually attractive im afraid im right im afraid get back low weight shes going want break ill never able get back point dont know im im unhappy want able cry arms tell help want tell im struggling dont want marry shes worked sex drive helped understand better helped figure needs want tell shes selfish getting help knowing im struggling want tell shes every bit bad thinks shes creating self fulfilling prophecy want tell shes every bit doesnt want anymore get help tell help cant marry rather know cant kids bad know ill collapse kids uses excuse never sex say collapse know wont cheat cant love much im selfless cheating wrong cant would break part want keep part thats dreamer believes hope cant tell im venting want advice anymore im need help,11,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jhx9as/ive_never_told_my_girlfriend_the_reason_i_stopped/,Neutral,Moderate Concern,us,39.7837304,-100.445882,1.0

Luckily the family that adopted him didn’t live that far from us so nearly everyday I walked to that house and watched him when he would go outside to play with his friends, I watched him grow up and start going to high school and I was so proud of him. Once I went to college I wasn’t able to watch him for a couple of years but after graduation I decided that maybe it was time to move on, once he moved out of his “parent’s” house I decided to follow him.

1jil8n5,2025-03-24T13:03:33,Is this fear about my partner normal?,"I (15) have a partner who I love very much. As weird as it sounds, I’ve developed this horrid fear that they might feel forced to stay with me and wouldnt leave if they were unhappy. 

I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts/attempts as well as sh for most of my life and my partner was aware of this long before we got together. Our relationship is going really well, with no issues between us, so this fear doesn’t really make sense. Still, Im oddly terrified that they might eventually feel like they have to stay with me out of fear that I would kill myself if they left.

I dont think that my partner currently feels trapped Im more worried in a future sense, I dont want it to turn into one of those stories you hear about the crazy ex-gf :( Id also never threaten to hurt myself if they tried to leave but still Im so scared of this. 

Is it normal to have these fears and how do I even deal with them? It’s starting to really get to my head and Idk what to do.

1jh99wo,2025-03-22T19:40:14,Friend broke my heart,"Hello everyone,
So I was getting real close with this person on Instagram who I didn’t even reach out to. She reached out to me. We hit it off real quick and became the best of friends. She always wanted to talk to me and she never missed a moment to talk to me. 

But then, she gets a boyfriend. He idolizes her all over his profile. Then reposts her pics without her knowledge or permission and blasts her all over his stories and posts like he just met an alien from a distant galaxy and won a huge prize. It was disgusting to say the least, especially since she’s only 14 and he’s almost an adult man. Ewww. He then boasts about how he’s gonna marry her and he literally just asked her to be his gf like a couple days prior.

When I first told her what he was doing, she was kind of uncomfortable with knowing he was doing that. I then warned her about the dangers of men his age in a loving and caring way. She was very grateful for the advice. We continue on as friends for about another week.

Then she starts changing. She slowly starts taking longer to reply, is not available as much, and is always on “active now” but never replies to me. She comes back with “so sorry! (Insert dumb excuse here) I’m going to bed now. Love you bestieeee!” Ok no big deal right?

Nope! The next morning I say “hello” she leaves me on “seen” and her profile disappears. It appears as tho she blocked me since you can find her profile on a web browser while being logged out. I tried texting her cell, no dice. I even called her but it went straight to voicemail. I guess she blocked me everywhere. 

But why!?! What the hell did I ever do to her! We were cool and we were inseparable. But I guess I was a fool for thinking that. Not only does she block me with no explanation, but she abandons me on the day I come down with a cold no less! Like WTF dude! This isn’t the first time this happens to me either. Seems like a pattern with people. They find a new partner, the friends all take a backseat. Especially the single ones. Ouch.

I’m tired of being treated like this. I get if someone needs space or a break but at least have the courtesy to tell me 5 words. I. Don’t. Want. To. Talk. Or even 3 like, Leave. Me. Alone. It hurts but at least I’ll respect that. But she didn’t even have the courtesy to do that. Why do people do this?!? Why would she break my heart like this after all the time we spent together?

Was she just using me to fill a void until she found a guy and I became an afterthought once he came? Or was he forcing her to stop talking to me because he got jealous of how much time I was spending with her. Cause that’s happened too.

Please folks, try to help me understand because I’m tired of this shit.

1jh97pp,2025-03-22T19:37:18,Help me help her,"
We (FF/49&45) have been together for 11 years, 8 of them married. We’ve been through lots of ups & downs life wise but never really relationship wise, we never had a reason to fight or argue, we calmly discussed our problems. We always got along wonderfully, we never stopped going on dates, writing each other sweet notes, chores are ~50/50 depending on who has more time & energy. 
About a 1 ago we started arguing every now & then but it resolved quickly until the arguments repeated again & again,we never really resolved the cause.. mostly issues with jealousy, being afraid I’ll leave her for someone else. Starting with her suddenly getting jealous & seeing everyone I’m close with as trying to get between us, no reason behind it apparently, on the way to a dinner party we argued & when we arrived I went to another friend & left her to go alone, I realize I should’ve handled this more calmly & I apologized for getting louder & leaving, since then it’s not really the same anymore, I don’t know if she got scared or anything, she knows Im not violent, I didn’t scream at her, I know she hates that, but I think she sees small issues as an argument already& getting upset as getting angry.  

She has a history of abusive relationships,went no contact with most family, she was diagnosed with cptsd/gad, battled addiction , suicidal thoughts,all before we met. It was never a problem for our relationship in my eyes, she was always more or less worried it would affect our relationship. Jealousy might have something to do w/ her body dismorphia which I think has been around since the jealousy started. She jumped from one diet to another from time to time. 
When I ask her what’s wrong she either says nothing’ ‘I’m just not feeling well’ ‘I don’t wanna talk about it’ when I ask her friends they say they don’t know, maybe a depressive episode which has happened in the past: she stopped talking to me told me it’s nothing, until a nervous breakdown, I supported her through therapy and everything seemed to be going well, after that we got married, bout two years in a similar episode, but resolved quickly. 

We barely talk sometimes, if we do we argue. Few days we actually act like a couple, I try not to ruin those moments by not mentioning anything about these issues.
I usually do her hair/nails, she asks me to do it, we make put a time, but then tells me she doesn’t feel like it anymore, I make breakfast, plan dates, try to talk to her, nothing from her side, she barely eats some days, she goes to bed at 7pm sometimes and spending much more time in bed.. I have no idea how to save our relationship. I think she thinks  I already decided for myself I’m gonna divorce anyway & there’s no point in doing anything about it. I’m willing to go to any therapy she wants, I suggested couples therapy she said ‘you don’t believe in that anyway’ I said that in the very beginning to a friend, idk how she even remembers that. She said ‘you’ll leave me anyways’ 

When I asked her best friend she said ‘maybe a depressive episode, please stay with her’  (To her friends she seems quite normal, despite being more depressed, she talks to them laughs w/ them, they go out together. ) What if it’s worse than that, last time it was her mom passing away, I would know if someone else passed away, what if it’s a bad diagnosis? Or hers?

It bothered her that I work longer or stay in the car for a while, when she told me that I came home early the whole week but we barely talked & spend the rest of the day in different rooms, following week I worked longer again she complained I don’t wanna come home to her, I told her whats the point if she ignores me, she said nothing & left. Half my friends are apparently flirting with me and wanting to date me, one she even titled as a competition to her. 

For everyone suspecting she cheated, I’d put my hand in fire, she’s the most loyal person I know.   I want to help her but I can’t if she doesn’t want any help or can’t even tell me what’s wrong..
How do I talk to her..

Sorry for the long read, Tried to make it as short as possible,

It sprang out of a recognition that, on other COVID19 subs, people were asking questions they wanted answered, but that those subs did not want to set themselves up to answer. A space was needed where self-posts were welcomed and responded to. 

A lot has changed since then. Mostly – and this is extremely important for how this sub operates –COVID19 has come, has been conquered (by vaccination, by evolution of less serious strains, by herd immunity that, going forward, will be embedded in childhood) and has largely gone. It's over, and we're out the other side. 

For the vast, vast majority of people, life today doesn't – and doesn't need to – look significantly different to how it did in 2019. And if it does for you, because you have serious underlying health conditions or because you don't want things to go back to normal, this is not the place for you. If you fall into the former category, you need qualified medical professionals' advice on how to navigate the residual risks of the pandemic; and if you're in the latter category, you need qualified medical professionals' advice on how to get past this. No-one here is qualified to give you either.

This is the place for you if you want it to go back to normal but are struggling to get there (users here are great for explaining how they have coped, and offering suggestions, or helping you to realise that even if you've had a really tought three years, it won't always be like this); if you have family members who are significantly more or less cautious than you and want help and suggesions with how to deal with them (which may be that they're right and you're ... less right, and you would may be best giving them some leeway); and if – as was initially intended – you need help understanding something in the media or a scientific journal that's not entirely clear. That last one is pretty much the only one I wanted to be answering when I started this sub but the rest of you had other ideas. I rolled with it, mostly. But I drew the line at things I didn't think were helpful, such as validating extreme behaviours. I will continue to do so. 

The sub is much quieter these days than it used to be - which is absolutely the way it should be. People largely no longer need advice about to deal with the pandemic because it's pretty much over. We're out the other side. 

**For those of you who do still find your way here** \- please take note of what's written above. This isn't the place for people who don't want to ever go into a crowded bar again, or think air travel is death sentence, or aren't ever going to send their kids to in-person school. There are places on reddit to connect with people who think like that; personally I think they're as dangerous as the subs that, in mid-2020, were calling for no restrictions at all, and which tell you vaccination will cause cancer and kill you, but unlike those sub they're not a danger to society so if that's where you want to be, it's ultimately up to you - please go there. But please leave my sub alone.

Throughout the pandemic, we have walked (hopefully successfully) a fine line between making reasonable adjustments to behaviour where they're justified, and calling them out where they're not - e.g. in April 2020, keep your distance in a supermarket or the street, but don't bleach your groceries. In April 2023, enjoy your graduation ceremony/cousin's wedding/Taylor Swift concert. Times change. Holding the middle ground hasn't always made us popular (with lockdown skeptics or those who don't want lockdown to ever end) but popularity isn't everything: accuracy and facts are. 

So, here we are, close enough to the end that it was time to replace a sticky that was out of date. Some of the rules/info below needed a refresh, some didn't, but it was time to update. 

Thanks to those of you who've stuck with us, all the best to those who've drifted away, and I sincerely hope we never, ever, have to do this again.

I've already made preparations for medically assisted end of life in Switzerland and I must say I am feeling way better knowing I won't have to suffer this anymore. My arrangement is in 2 months just to give time if there's a miracle that will help me.   


Most people I've seen on reddit has Never recovered their sense of taste and smell, and those that did are very few and happened within 2 weeks. Since mine has gone on for more than 2 weeks I have reason to believe this is no longer recovering.   


It is a sad thought that I would be leaving soon, but I think it's the most respectful thing I can do to myself as I would at least be in a controlled environment with my mental state intact rather than being  completely down and mentally unstable and give myself unnecessary pain.

Fast-forward to Tuesday and he has a full blown cold with sore throat improving but today he woke up and sounds worse. Still mostly cold-like. 

Now my other sibling has a sore throat. I've yet to show symptoms but I'm freaking out about getting Covid again or the flu. I'm the only one fully vaccinated although all of us have had an infection last year. I do not want it again because it was so traumatic.

Our mother is immunocompromised (diabetes, CKD, blood cancer) and yet **no one is taking me seriously and wearing a mask around her**, *she's* not even wearing a mask around them but thankfully doesn't have symptoms. 

I'm worried about her as she may have a blood clot or infection in her arm (going to Dr today) but no one is taking my worries about this seriously. My siblings are still going to school and work. I'm worried about them getting LC or worse, spreading it to others.

158etfi,2023-07-24T21:34:14,The Cold That Keeps Going - Tips on Accelerating Mid-Term Recovery? Semi-Long COVID,"Me and my girlfriend being self-employed working from home avoided COVID for over 3 years. She's a Travel Writer so we knew it would eventually get us when she started traveling again.  She tested positive with mild symptoms late May this year and I never got it miraculously. I was triple boosted with last booster a month before she got it, she was double. (I have Asthma sometimes in the Summer accompanied by allergies so I got the extra booster.) So the extra booster may have spared me this first time.

After she returned from a trip to Alaska a month later, she had extreme fatigue and never thought to test until I suggested it and BAM second infection in 5 weeks!  This time I was not spared. We both had moderate fever, running nose, fatigue first 5 days but not bad enough we couldn't get out of bed but didn't have the energy to really get much work done.  It later moved to the chest with cough and moderate chest congestion.  3 weeks later we feel 80% normal. Still easily tired out as the day goes on, ocassional dry cough, tightness feeling in chest, ocassional headache. Really makes it hard to put in a full day's work but luckily no brain fog just a little more forgetful when feeling exhausted.  It seems we are experiencing sort of semi-long COVID.  We feel a very tiny bit better each day but at this rate I'd say we are on a trajectory to be back to 100% in another couple months!

I've been researching anything we can do to accelerate the recovery.  Only thing that sounded semi-studied was making sure you have good Amino Acid intake and possibly some B-vitamin intake can help. I drink a couple Whey protein shakes with berries each day and a multi-B supplement.  Otherwise I suspect the only thing you can do is try to sleep as much as possible without affecting your work to the point it effects your livelihood.

Anyone else find any strategies that helped accelerate recovery when you were still feeling pretty tired/fatigued and somewhat stuffy over 3 weeks later?

I'm pretty sure we got two different variants.  The first was probably one of the earlier Omicron variants and the one we just experienced was probably XBB Arcturus (or Kraken?)  These XBB variants are known to easily breakthrough even double boosted protection and it is currently the variants the Fall Booster is being designed to address. They are highly contagious and I think a lot of people think COVID is history so I know people that said they had a cold this Summer that didn't even think to test for COVID thereby probably unknowlingly spreading it.  COVID doesn't care what season it is. A lot of people don't get that.

13w06yr,2023-05-31T01:21:17,Mental recovery after severe case of COVID pneumonia?,"Hi all,   
Backstory: my mother (age 50) endured a serious case of COVID pneumonia during January 2022. During her stay in the ICU, she went through dialysis and had to be intubated. I was told she wasn't going to make it but to everyone's surprise, she pulled through. Little did we know that the subsequent months after her release would be even worse. After a month of physical therapy, she returned back to the hospital for edema and and breathlessness. The second hospital visit was a blur (I blocked out a lot of my memories from this time) but the doctor had injected something into her vein (unsuccessfully) so they had to perform a surgery on her arm. 

  
Currently, she is doing fine physically. The problem is, she will not talk to us about her emotional and mental health. I know that she is dealing with PTSD especially after being in the ICU alone for so long. She was prescribed Zoloft and she said it's been helping. Everyday, she just sits and watches TV. I try to get her to go outside but she refuses and I don't want to be pushy. She will wash dishes and walk around the house from time to time. She's very anti-social, doesn't laugh like she used to, and rarely replies back to us. It has been over a year and there's barely an improvement. She's obviously still depressed. I'm honestly afraid her mental obstructions will affect her physical health too. For a family that never speaks about mental health, it's really hard for us to grasp the nature of it all. 

  
It's also difficult when there's barely any studies or personal stories regarding severe long-covid symptoms. To those that have family members going through what my mom is enduring, do you have advice?

Looking for any advice or support. The neuropathy I've had really scares me, as it's the only thing not going away.","In June 2020, I quit my 30mg dosage of Lexapro, that I had taken since 2016, cold turkey, due to a few things.

1. I was constantly anxious and OCD, and Lexapro wasn't helping at all. I probably had built up a very strong tolerance to it.
2. My APRN prescriber (not my primary care doctor or a psychiatrist) was a hassle to deal with and not a very nice person. She was a good person to deal with at first, but later on became less interested in me, and seemed indifferent to my declining mental state. She also upped my dosage of Lexapro to 30mg over time, for reasons I cannot remember. In 2020, just before the cold turkey, I had suggested to her that I possibly switch to another medication, as I thought Lexapro wasn't working anymore, and she refused to change me to something else.
3. The APRN moved to Texas in 2015. She never suggested seeing somebody locally after they moved. They are not licensed to practice in Texas, only RI, CT, OR, and WA. Texas law says they need to work with a physician to practice psych med management, but they are not licensed in Texas, they only live there, so I'm not sure legally what they are required to do. I live in Rhode Island, and I could only get a refill through telehealth webcam visits, and my webcam didn't work for the session in June, meaning they refused to give me a refill, and didn't suggest other ways to get one.

I started taking over the counter 5-HTP as a replacement for the Lexapro, but it had no effect either. Nothing was helping my anxiety at all last year. It came to a head in late September 2020, after being at the ER for an intense panic attack that spanned 3 days, until I was able to cool down at the ER. A mental health social worker had been to my house during the breakdown, but referred me to a mental health facility that wasn't taking any new patients, rendering that service useless, in a time when I was having an intense breakdown of emotions. The last time this had happened was in 2012, which led to my OCD/Anxiety diagnosis.

I re-contacted the APRN, as they were a person who knew my case, as I had seen them for 6 years by then, and were able to see me very soon after this breakdown, and she put back on Lexapro, but at a 10mg dosage this time, instead of 30mg. They didn't seem concerned about me quitting 30mg cold turkey, the fact that I had quit in general so harshly, the fact that EMTs/Police had been to the house because of my breakdown, no real concern. She also did not want me to run any health tests before putting me back on medication, nor did she ask if I was taking any supplements or other medications, such as the 5-HTP I had previously taken, when if combined with an SSRI can cause serotonin syndrome, which can be fatal.

About 2 to 3 weeks into this reinstatement, I remember feeling a very heavy, dull, numb-like feeling in my head that built up over a few days, mainly at the top of my head, but it felt like it was inside my brain too. I began having jaw stiffness during the day (Not really bruxism, because it wasn't clenching, my jaw would just jut out unconsciously), and then I started getting acute and severe health symptoms one on top of another. I had to stop taking Lexapro again due to these problems, as I thought at the time the reinstatement was causing this. The symptoms I can recall having occur suddenly from mid October 2020 to now are;

1. Brain fog, I have periods of derealization, and just a general incorrect mental feeling.
2. Memory loss, both short-term and long-term. Old memories are gone/fuzzy. Hard to remember words, day-to-day memory is spotty, hard to remember things done during the same day sometimes.
3. Sinus inflammation
4. Throbbing headaches
5. Muscle twitching (Used to be very intense, mainly in my legs and stomach)
6. Bad cough
7. Dry mouth (Only in times when I was anxious, though)
8. Extremely dry, throbbing lips (Not sure if anxiety caused this, but for about 4 days my lips were in intense pain while that happened),
9. Extreme fatigue
10. Watery mucus
11. Dry sinuses
12. Nerve and muscle problems (Mainly in the left side of my face, neck, chest, genitals, and seldom in my left foot, in the sole area. My neck feels painful and stiff a lot on the left side, I would get quick, almost zap-like chest pains on both sides of my chest a few months ago, but now it's only on the left side, my face on the left side will sometimes feel tingly, burning, or weak, or numb, my genitals only hurt in the left testicle and on the left side of my penis when I move it a certain way. The right side of my leg feels weak at times too. My left foot would have a burning feeling sometimes)
13. An intense bout of facial warmness (One day my entire face felt like it was on fire, I had an ice pack on it all night)
14. Ear ringing (Either side multiple times a day)
15. Nausea
16. Pale lips
17. An iron deficiency
18. Numb emotions and numb libido
19. Breathing problems (Sometimes I have to manually breathe instead of automatically, and my breathing can get labored and shallow)
20. Blood in my mucus/phlegm
21. Body pain/burning in my upper body about 5 to 10 minutes after waking up, eventually goes away after I get out of bed

Some of these symptoms have improved, and some haven't. Everything save for neuropathy, memory, and blunted emotions is pretty much gone. The neuropathy used to manifest as burning and tingling, and now is reduced sensitivity. It only affects the left side of my body, even in my genital area. The left side of my genitals are not affected. The neuropathy now manifests as reduced sensitivity and sometimes stinging pains in my genitals.

The APRN refused to have me as a client after these symptoms occurred, even though they were more than happy to take me on as a client after I had quit cold turkey and had a breakdown. They now made the stipulation that I needed to see a therapist before I would be able to see this APRN again, and this was something they had never required beforehand. My mother was sick with terminal cancer at the same time as this, and this person was of no emotional support, instead one time getting upset with me for ""waking them up"" by calling them, even though it was the only number they use for their practice, and saying insulting things like ""I should have gone to therapy long before this"", even though in the 6 years I had seen them, they had never required it. Even after I saw a therapist, their excuse became ""We both decided you should see somebody locally for med management"", something they had never said beforehand, and was something they never suggested after they left to move to Texas.

This APRN had never required me, in the 6 years I had seen them, to regularly see a PCP or a therapist. Only after these problems happened, did they require me to see a therapist. They never mentioned seeing a PCP. It's strange, as this person advertises her practice as being both therapy and medication management. Also, how would the APRN know if I wasn't seeing a therapist? She worked independently, many states away. It seems like a fake excuse to get rid of me, as she may have thought she caused my health problems.

She also never referred me to anybody themselves, leaving me to do that. I'm guessing they got scared that they possibly caused these problems, and wanted to dump me as soon as possible, making me feel like I was in the wrong.

Over two years later, I am still not really sure what caused this. Some have suggested it is long COVID, some have said that the Lexapro reinstatement might have caused a ""kindling"" effect in my brain/nervous system, since I had gone off 30mg cold turkey, and some suggest it's intense stress. Maybe it was serotonin syndrome, due to the 5-HTP usage just before going back on Lexapro? I don't know. All that I do know, is about 2 to 3 weeks into Lexapro reinstatement, I got very sick. It began with a mushy, weird, numb feeling in my head, not a headache, and then I started getting a ton of weird vascular/neurological/nerve related problems, as well as sinus inflammation.

I feel my symptoms are way too severe to be caused by anything related to Lexapro, as this is a medication I took since I was 18 years old, and had cold turkey'd previously more than once, with the worst thing happening being worse mood, most likely due to the harsh withdrawal. For instance, I believe in 2016 I stopped taking it for about a month or two, noticed getting very depressed, and went back on. In 2018/2019 I also quit it again, but went back on a few months later, with the worst feeling being feeling spaced out, but not sick. I never had any physical or neurological symptoms going back on it.

I have been left emotionally traumatized by this treatment. I was diagnosed with severe depression by a psychologist. I am still seeing doctors to find out my mystery chronic illness. I do not know if legally this NP is liable, but in my view, she acted in a way that should warrant it. She was reckless and cruel at a time when I needed emotional support the most. Her actions possibly kept me from being able to spend time with my dying mother. After my mother passed away, the NP's advice for me was ""working relieves anxiety"" and when I told her I was trying to get SSI, that it's very hard to do.
