1gd9l9c,2024-10-27T17:43:33,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

1e297nd,2024-07-13T17:55:58,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Recently started getting help for chronic pain from an injury from domestic violence that happened 2 years ago. I didn't go to the doctor when the assault happened because I was all alone and dissociating so badly I could barely function. It was all I could do just to survive and go to work every day. I was dissociating so badly it was more like brain damage. There were people who thought I was ""like that"" from using drugs. I was walking around with my neck half broken trying to comprehend that I almost got murdered. My ex boyfriend  the drug addict, not me.

Looking slightly... off was really appealing to my narcissistic boss who bullied me and made me leave a work site where I was happy and had friends who looked out for me. I have friends at my new work site, but they dont take care of me like my old friends did. I just have to, like, perform normality and do social interactions with them. My closest friend at work right now is a college kid 12 years younger than me.

I have had a pattern of getting my life ripped out from under me. Clearly I was raised to be just a really fun person to bully out of basic human rights. But honestly, it's gone mainstream and it's not cool anymore. Ruining my life for narcissistic fun isn't very indie rock. Too many people are into it. Ticket prices are through the roof.

Yesterday I came in for an afternoon at work after spending the morning at the doctor getting x rays for my neck injury and my boss and another coworker both looked furious to find out I wasn't just being dramatic and really was in as much pain as I said I was.

Things I do:
- Meditate
- Journal, obsessively, it's like telling an exercise junkie who is always training for a new marathon to ""try jogging""
- take care of myself
- have self esteem, think I'm cool and pretty

Things I haven't tried:
- getting to rest while a whole other person cooks me dinner and tells me I'm cool and pretty

Call for Help

Hello, I'm 22F. (French)

I've been taking venlafaxine 150 mg since I was 16. Last year, I went abroad for a year and, due to a prescription error, I was forced to halve my dose for six months. The first few days were horrible, but I quickly got used to it.

When I returned to France, I decided to go back to 150 mg because the return was a bit difficult.
I started working in a hotel in December when the problems started. (I'd already been waking up sometimes with swelling in random places on my body for six months, but I blamed that on the humid climate.)

But this swelling persisted and came back with a vengeance. I sometimes wake up with a swollen hand, foot, finger, or eye.  I also sometimes have swelling on the soles of my feet, which makes it difficult to walk. It's also accompanied by severe hives all over my body (photo attached).

It's quite difficult psychologically, because no doctor has been able to help me, and only cortisone works. I scratch all day long, sometimes until I bleed. During severe attacks, the itching is so intense that I scratch with a brush or scissors.

Two weeks ago, I accidentally opened the venlafaxine leaflet and discovered that swelling and hives were listed as side effects. But the doctors don't think I've developed an allergy after years of treatment. After yet another appointment, the doctor put me back on 75 mg and increased my antihistamine dose.

So, that's been two or three weeks.  The first few days of withdrawal were excruciating, but it quickly calmed down. The hives and swelling are still there but have calmed down significantly.
But now, my mental state has been in freefall for a few days. I've rarely felt like this. I'm paranoid, I always have a lump in my stomach, I'm always on the verge of crying, I cry whenever I get the chance. I see everything in black.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to increase the dose because I'd like to get off this medication long-term, as I have too many other side effects (drowsiness, libido, electric shock in my brain, etc.). Incidentally, I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything like that. I just went there as a teenager for a feeling of unease (like all teenagers in the world, really), and they gave me a drastic treatment.  (I've since stopped taking anti-anxiety medications.)

Well, I'm not even sure if this phase where I'm not feeling well is due to withdrawal. So that's why I'd like to know your experiences with venlafaxine Effexor and antidepressant withdrawal in general.

1jl906s,2025-03-27T22:39:19,1 month update!,"Hello wonderful people!
Putting this post out there to just spread my thoughts on therapy and how it’s helped me thus far.  

I didn’t go to therapy everyday for a month straight…I go once a week BUT next month is coming up and I have been consistent with it since the beginning of this month. Anyways I wanted to share my thoughts so far and what I’ve learned so far in my experience.

1. Therapy has been most beneficial (*for me at least*) when I felt I was serious and ready for it. I have tried therapy in my past but I never was actually ready I don’t think and kind of half-assed it. Having a clean slate, determination and willingness to participate has done a great job at keeping myself engaged and motivated on continuing to move forward. (There is no timeline for when people are ready for therapy, so don’t stress if you don’t feel up for it, you’ll feel ready on your own time like I did) 

2. I’ve been learning how to externalize anxiety and depression and I’ve more so been focusing on the anxiety portion. It’s helped me a lot, I would argue that my anxiety has decreased a good amount but definitely not to where I’d like it to me. Trying to learn how to sit with discomfort so I can truly accept things that are not in my control. 

3. Focusing on my mental health has in turn helped with my self-love. Even if it’s a small amount. I like to think of it as one part gets better, and eventually everything else that follows tends to get back in line. But remaining consistent has allowed me to focus on myself and challenging myself to change not only my actions but my identify overall. I have never been a huge reader but I picked up a book called “Atomic Habits” and so far I haven’t quit reading! 

4. Gratitude frees the soul, being grateful for the things in your life no matter how small has helped me realize just how precious life is and that even if things are not going as planned, believe it or not it can always be worse. Even if you are rockbottom you can always count on life throwing an extra curveball for no reason. Comparison is the thief of joy, remembering what you have and imagining how life would be WITHOUT what you have now is a gentle humbling reminder that life is hard enough as is. Be joyful for the things you do have because you’d be surprised how much harder life can be without your bits of pieces of your life. 

Of course this is MY experience and not a “THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO THERAPY”. Everyone has different experiences and thoughts which is entirely okay. My only suggestion is if you genuinely want to change and improve, you absolutely can because that power resides within you. The only person you have control over is yourself. So if you are considering therapy but aren’t entirely sure, I say do it! Even if you end up realizing you aren’t ready then that is okay. You tried and that is already you taking that first step. You can try again whenever you want. 

Anyways, thank you for listening to my rant. I plan to continue to attend therapy and hopefully continue to improve myself as a whole.

1jkrxiz,2025-03-27T06:29:26,Dissociation is ruining my productivity (and life),"Hello, M20 if this is of any meaning for whatever comes, lol.

It's a thing I've been doing for as long as I can remember and to be perfectly honest - I'm in so deep I could barely recognize it was a problem. I zone out/dissociate a LOT. Whenever we eat at the same table, my mom would often catch me sitting with my mouth hanging open, staring into the void, and wave her hand in front of me to bring me back. ""Hello? What are you thinking about?"" ""Nothing, stuff."" Pretty much my whole life is that. In elementary we had this type of math homework where you had to sit and solve a page of easy problems as fast as you could. Guess who'd zone out every 5 seconds? It's not that I couldn't solve them fast, no. In fact I feel like I have a lot of potential for learning, but only when I find myself in deep academic trouble and have to keep anxiously bringing myself back to reality to study, because at this point I'm flying the hell out of my university if I don't retake this exam.

Scheduling? Yeah, no. In no world I can plan to do something like go see a doctor or get a haircut and execute it the same day, nuh uh. Sometimes even when this is not the case, I can easily get anxious that I have to go somewhere and automatically zone out for an hour instead of processing it properly and finally doing what I have to do. Washing my hair? 20 minute task max - somehow takes me 2 hours. I'll rather start pacing around or go do something simple that doesn't require any cognitive input. One time I had to do a lab in HTML, like a simple 30 minute one. Took me a week. Don't ask, I have no idea how.

Needless to say, my episodic memory isn't the greatest. Everything's a blur unless it's something short and vivid. Even college is a blur and I'm literally on year 3 right now. My mood's swinging, energy levels look like a dubstep audio waveform, I'm barely able to control anger or emotions in general. I can get impulsive, lose motivation for everything or regain in. All that in a matter of, I dunno, hours, minutes?

So given all that, my zoning out is most likely just a defence mechanism. The zoning out itself takes many forms. I can fly to a better world, overthink, draw shapes with my mind, connect dots and so on. Creating scenarios in my head is the most dangerous one, since it can create expectations and, if involves other people, ruin relationships, ouch. 

Talking about ""other"" strategies to regulate my emotions, since childhood I punch myself pretty damn hard. On the head. Specifically forehead, riiight in the center. Or, well, sometimes a good bang on the wall helps, but I'm not so sure about the safety of such methods... Sounds like a big ouwie to me. Of course now I'm trying my best not to do that, but still somethimes I'm just too angry. I used to do that because I really didn't want to show my anger to anyone, especially my mother.

And overall? I was always a bit different. My favourite school subjects were everybody's hated  ones (God I love geometry) and my hated ones were everybody's favorite (God I hate algebra and history). I somehow got myself interested in things that noone else in my school was interested in, yet this is actually a good thing. Relationships my thing was and is not. Often I have trouble understanding why some things aren't or are acceptable, and why is this liked, but not that.

Would love to hear if anybody else has same experiences, cuz pretty confused.

1jgcbbq,2025-03-21T14:17:54,i hate chatgpt.,"i don't like how many people i see on this subreddit, or other mental health subreddits encouraging the use of chatgpt, however i don't really blame them. chatgpt doesn't know anything about your past, nor does it have the experience a human does, therefore it can't be empathetic in the same way and give you actual useful advice - most of it is from google that i find usually isn't too helpful for more severe, or intense illnesses or symptoms. on top of that, since chatgpt only mimics the empathy of a human, it's not giving you the real love and support like how an actual human would, if that makes sense. i don't think chatgpt is always horrible, for example i think chatgpt can be great for understanding things like the mental illness you have and it's symptoms. but it's absolutely not a replacement for real, human compassion and interaction.

on the other hand though, I understand people simply can't afford professional help thanks to the economy, as well as fear of judgment. i feel like people are so comfortable bullying people simply because they're different from them, or when they see a mental illness/symptom that isn't ""pretty"" they instantly make fun of that person, calling them gross, or a freak, psycho, or way worse. this literally disencourages people from getting the help that they need, and i think it happens way more than we're willing to admit. even for the most horrible symptoms, if you genuinely want someone to get help you have to be willing to sit down and understand where they're coming from.

Today I (18F) told my mother that I wished I was dead. I've been in and out of school due to mental health issues such as OCD and Social Anxiety and also lack of motivation. I haven't been able to keep a job more than half a year and It's been really rough staying at home feeling like a failure. I was supposed to go for an interview today after weeks and weeks of looking for a job. I was getting ready but no outfits that I picked looked right on me and I was beginning to panic. I didn't have any formal clothes so I had to improvise.

Everytime I put something on I hated how my body looked in it. Time ran out and I new I was going to be late. I told my mum I wasn't going and she got upset saying that I always do this, always change last minute, saying that what I had on was fine and there was nothing wrong with it. She told me that I've wasted an opportunity. I don't know what happened but I just blurted out ""I wish that I was dead"". She thought I was saying that because I couldn't find an outfit.

I don't think my mum's ever taken my mental state seriously and I think it's because she doesn't understand it but anyways,
I then left the house for a bit to cool down, had a cry and then came home. 

She called me to talk but the whole time she was talking I just tuned her out. She asked me what I was going to do and I told her I didn't know. 
I'm feeling quite lost at the moment and after this I feel like dying more than ever. I really regret the way things played out.

(TL;DR : I told my mum I wished I was dead and I regret it)

I wasn't managing anxiety. I was just managing around it. Turning insomnia into productivity. Masking panic attacks as bathroom breaks. Disguising hypervigilance as leadership qualities.

Today I finally understood: You can be drowning while everyone admires how well you swim. Your Google calendar can look flawless while your mind is in chaos.

Recently, I came home and had a severe breakdown at 2 am because a resident indirectly called me a triggering word. My sister was angry at me, which is understandable considering I was disturbing everyone's sleep.

While my mom was talking to me to calm me down, I did indirectly mention relapsing and thoughts of wanting to die. She told me to consider going to a mental hospital for a while once my semester was over to receive some help, especially because I refused therapy (I've tried multiple times, but every time I go, they push medication even though I'm against it).

This is the reason I don't say anything anymore. Each time it is always ""maybe you should go away for a while"" or something like that. Yes, I can see where my mom is coming from with my current headspace, but she acts as if I am like this 24/7. I have suicidal ideation, but I haven't SH'ed in two years, and I've never attempted. My food issues and body dysmorphia persist, but I'm not always acting on harmful behaviors.

I'm going through a rough patch, but my family, especially my mom, acts like I'm worse off 24/7.  Even if I went to a mental hospital, I'd still have good and bad periods as I do know.

1jgpjzj,2025-03-22T01:11:10,I hate how fast people switch up on those with mental illness,"Back in 2020 I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder. It seemed like back then there was more acceptance towards those who had mental illness. Now the “culture of care” we used to have is down the drain. When I first came out with having bipolar and depression I had friends and people around me who seemed to be supportive. Then a few years went by, I aged rapidly, I put on weight, started showing more obvious signs of depression, and became poor. Now it seems like those same people who supported me now avoid me like I’m diseased or gawk at me like I’m some kind of spectacle. 

Back in the throws of pandemic it was all “end the stigma” and “Kumbaya~ you can trust people, we want to help you” now the general consensus is “You’re on your own and no one’s coming to save you” and “Stop acting cringey and develop some social skills” or “If you’re in crisis you must be a crisis friend *blocked*”

And as a disclaimer…when I say ‘people’ I by no means am referring to everyone. I’ve had quite a few rad people reach out and check on me or even find ways to help me out. Having said that, it still doesn’t change the fact that I’m deeply hurt with how I was treated big-picture wise and by most people after my mental illness wasn’t ‘cute’ ‘fun’ or ‘quirky’ anymore. I just feel like I bought into the kindness trap, got too comfortable around people, then everyone turned their backs on me. I feel hurt, disgusted, betrayed, and most of all I felt abandoned. 

As of recently I got a new job. In short, I saw the writing on the wall that the economic situation was about to get worse for many industries. So I hopped on an opportunity for a job that is (in most cases) a safe option during times of economic downturns.

ive hit people before, but ive never actually beat or seriously injured anyone. It’s only if they put their hands on me first. I am not a victim to my thoughts, I don’t have harm ocd or anything of the sorts because I find my urges and fantasies cathartic and sometimes even enjoyable and I never feel bad about these urges.

1jhcfor,2025-03-22T22:02:23,"i went through 10+ times of sexual assault, but my therapist says i dont have ptsd.","tw for sh, suicide, CSA

hi, i am turning 17 now. when i was 5 i was raped by my family members, then it stopped for a while and when i turned 11, i was raped again. in total it was 10+ times, i suspect it could be 15 times.

i repressed all of this until i turned 14. when the memories came back i was in a state of depression, feeling numb, feeling like my body was in autopilot, using indifference to cope. i started self harming as a result. and obviously there were thoughts of suicide. 

once i was forced to report these incidents to the police, my state got worse. then i got school counseling which didnt help at all. after a while i started going for talk therapy with a trauma trained therapist/psychologist.

i mustered up the courage to ask her if she thinks i have ptsd. she said i didnt.

honestly im hurt. i feel like it invalidated my trauma. if i dont have ptsd, then what the hell is wrong with me? she said that while i had all the symptoms needed to be diagnosed for ptsd, my symptoms werent acute enough. is this a joke? so i have what, budget ptsd?


im sorry if this offends people who do have ptsd, maybe i just dont understand. but i seriously have nothing? no mental illness? just mental issues? so these years of dissociating in and out, repressing memories, self harm, suicide attempts, abandonment issues, hypersexuality issues, self sabotaging, nightmares, anger issues, emotional dysregulation... etc. theyre not anything? 

my whole life, i have defined my whole life around these traumas. every moment, i am thinking about it. even when im hanging out with friends or not conciously thinking about it, its always in the back of my mind. i can only see a worthless piece of trash in the mirror, a ruined body, a disgusting mind, my whole life. does it matter anymore?

1jj3kua,2025-03-25T03:42:53,Is this Real? Will the daydreams stop?,"There are times when I wonder if I’m really struggling with my mental health at all. It's like I'm caught in this endless loop of questioning myself, my feelings, and my reality. On one hand, I feel like I can't get anything right. My emotions don’t match how I think I’m supposed to feel, and I’m constantly second-guessing whether what I’m experiencing is real.

Most of the time, I feel numb—like I don’t care about anything, and it’s hard to find meaning in anything I do. But then, there are moments where I feel a spark, like a desire to be happy, to actually experience joy. But once that feeling starts, I find myself pulling back, questioning if it’s real. Is this happiness, or am I just pretending? Am I really capable of feeling this way, or is it all just a facade?

And the worst part is, I start to wonder if I’ve been faking it the whole time. If I’ve been using my mental health struggles as some sort of attention-seeking act, when in reality, maybe I’ve always been okay. Maybe I’ve just been convincing myself—and everyone else—that I’m struggling when, in truth, I’m fine. This thought spirals into a deep sense of shame, like I’m somehow doing something wrong or dishonest, when all I really want is to feel understood.

It’s such a confusing cycle—sometimes, I feel like I’m truly struggling, and other times, I question everything, wondering if I’m just pretending. It feels like I can’t trust myself, like I’m always at odds with my own mind. And honestly, it’s exhausting. But I know I have to keep reminding myself that it’s okay to not have all the answers, to not feel completely certain. Mental health is messy, and sometimes, even the act of questioning itself is part of the process.

And then there’s the daydreaming. Sometimes, my mind takes me to places where I’m someone completely different—someone strong and skilled, someone who’s capable of incredible things. I imagine myself as a weapons specialist, a car or motorcycle expert, or a computer genius. In these daydreams, I’m always the one in control, the one with the power and the knowledge to fix things. I’ve always been some type of specialist, always the strongest in my mind.

But then there are other times when I’m not the one in control. I’m the damsel in distress, the person caught in some kind of prophecy, or maybe the villain who’s forced into that role by a powerful parent, even though I know deep down I want to be the hero. And then, there are moments when I’m an agent with superpowers, in the middle of a car chase, desperately trying to protect someone—only, that someone is always just someone I’ve imagined in that moment.

I never thought this was normal. I still don’t. It feels weird. Sometimes it feels like I’m living in my own world, removed from the one around me. It’s almost like I’m acting out these roles in my head, these fantasies that feel so real. And that’s the hardest part. How do I explain this to my therapist without sounding completely, utterly crazy? Because, honestly, it feels crazy.

I want to feel present, but when I’m so wrapped up in these daydreams, it’s like I can’t. It’s terrifying sometimes to feel like my reality is slipping, to feel disconnected from everything happening around me. I wish I could just be *here*, in the moment, without all of these distractions, without questioning my every thought and feeling. But it’s hard, especially when I’m trying to make sense of it all.",mentalhealth,times wonder im really struggling mental health like im caught endless loop questioning feelings reality one hand feel like cant get anything right emotions dont match think im supposed feel im constantly secondguessing whether im experiencing real time feel numblike dont care anything hard find meaning anything moments feel spark like desire happy actually experience joy feeling starts find pulling back questioning real happiness pretending really capable feeling way facade worst part start wonder ive faking whole time ive using mental health struggles sort attentionseeking act reality maybe ive always okay maybe ive convincing myselfand everyone elsethat im struggling truth im fine thought spirals deep sense shame like im somehow something wrong dishonest really want feel understood confusing cyclesometimes feel like im truly struggling times question everything wondering im pretending feels like cant trust like im always odds mind honestly exhausting know keep reminding okay answers feel completely certain mental health messy sometimes even act questioning part process theres daydreaming sometimes mind takes places im someone completely differentsomeone strong skilled someone whos capable incredible things imagine weapons specialist car motorcycle expert computer genius daydreams im always one control one power knowledge fix things ive always type specialist always strongest mind times im one control im damsel distress person caught kind prophecy maybe villain whos forced role powerful parent even though know deep want hero moments im agent superpowers middle car chase desperately trying protect someoneonly someone always someone ive imagined moment never thought normal still dont feels weird sometimes feels like im living world removed one around almost like im acting roles head fantasies feel real thats hardest part explain therapist without sounding completely utterly crazy honestly feels crazy want feel present im wrapped daydreams like cant terrifying sometimes feel like reality slipping feel disconnected everything happening around wish could moment without distractions without questioning every thought feeling hard especially im trying make sense,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jj3kua/is_this_real_will_the_daydreams_stop/,Neutral,Moderate Concern

1jl1gzw,2025-03-27T16:44:21,I Can't F*cking Take It Anymore - My Mental Health has Totally Collapsed.,"All that I am thinking about is one day ten years ago.  I had an opportunity (I thought at least), to get out of a dead end job in a dead end career.  I thought it was an opportunity but I stupidity ignored my stupid gut again which screamed at me, ""Don't you f\*cking do it! You will regret it!""

Ten years later -  I was absolutely right.

I knew that there was no good or great future for me.  There isn't.  I work best alone.  This is how I had worked in a stupid role for ten years that allowed me some very lower level of contentment and means to ""live."" Albeit, not actually living in a normal or conventional sense, but making it through each excruciating moment of each day numbed to all of lifes toxic and negative elements.

I talked myself into moving out of this role and thought, ""Yea, I had my circle of coworkers I had worked with, what could go wrong if I left this ten year job?""

I am too different in every way. I think too differently and act too differently.  I used to be able to effectively con my way into making others think I was normal like them - that ability was taken from me by mentally ill criminals that are (clearly) above the law. 

As a result, there is NO WAY that I can communicate with ANYONE without them stating in one form or the other, ""they don't understand me,"" despite the simple laymen terms that I am using to communicate my complex and detailed thoughts.

I have TRIED EVERYTHING.  There is NOTHING that anyone can tell me that I don't already know -- the answer inevitably is, PEOPLE ARE PIECES OF SHIT. 

I NEED, I WANT, A normal f\*cking job.  Not this stupid field (IT / Tech), when leadership and management can't spell IT and therefore don't have a clue as how to manage it.  I want out of this sh\*tty field.  I want a normal role in a normal job in ANY OTHER FIELD, where I can be told, ""Do this, this way,"" and leave it at the end of the day every day.  Nothing more, nothing less.

I can't stand listening to people's obvious and blatant negative, toxic, abusive, predatory and wrong opinions, thoughts, and very low knowledge.  If you don't have something nice, good, or intelligent to say, shut your f\*cking mouth before I report you to the federal, state, and local authorities as a domestic terrorist.  

I do not have an ego.  I am not almighty.  I am just a person that knows themself in and out deeply.  I know the creature that I am, what I know, don't know, and what is best for me.  I know WHO people are in the first two seconds that they open their stupid f\*cking mouths to let drool fall out of it.

I do not want to try to change people. Ignorant people (among others), are the second major threat to society and thus why I want nothing to do with them ( or anyone else.  I simply want to be left the h\*ll  alone.  I (medically) do not have energy to listen to unintelligent banter from people with whom advertise their pedophilic and homicidal urges.

Where are the stupid normal jobs that will allow me to go back to working alone so that I can regain some small peace that I once had?

Special Note:

I have ZERO expectation of anyone understanding any of this and that is the point.  I could put together diagrams and write out thousands of pages that explain this in detail and you would still tell me, ""I don't understand you.""

From my experience, I believe that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is the easiest and most effective method we can practice on our own. This is because it focuses on accepting thoughts rather than trying to change them.

ACT combines elements of psychotherapy and mindfulness

Changing thoughts requires multiple sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and while it can work, it often doesn’t. On the other hand, accepting thoughts through ACT principles is much easier.

You can find a guide to ACT therapy on the Play Store at this link. I look forward to hearing your thoughts thank you!

Before I get into it I just want to say that it's worse than how I will describe, I just don't have it in me to admit the awful things my brain terrorizes me with, frankly I'm so ashamed.

Every day I think of people that hurt me, I cannot emphasize enough that their names are literally floating in my head every second of every day. When I'm busy, when I'm alone, and now as I'm writing this.

I have terrible thoughts about people I love, people that are dear to me, people I would take a bullet for without a second thought.
Because of this, I am considering suicide, because I feel such guilt that is getting difficult to live with.

I don't know what to do, and when I try to open up about this to my family all I'm met with is, “Jesus is the only way.” this is getting frustrating to hear as I'm an atheist and I'm not changing that.

doqwow,2019-10-29T20:22:02,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type response usually leads either disappointment disaster usually works quite differently say pm anytime casual social context huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship many support others flag inappropriate content even know many struggling hard work behind scenes information resources make easier give get quality help small start new wiki page explains detail much better respond public comments least youve gotten know someone maintained rdepressionwikiprivatecontact full text current version summary anyone acting helper invites accepts private contact ie pms chat kind offsite communication early conversion showing either bad intentions bad judgement either way unwise trust pm anytime seems like kind generous offer might perfectly wellmeaning unless solid rapport established wise idea points consider offer accept invitation communicate privately posting supportive replies publicly youll help people op responses good quality youll educate inspire helpers rulehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiruleinternetculture applies much anywhere else internet people struggling serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably low tolerance disappointment highlevel everchanging emotional need unless helper able make commitment every way long necessary offering personal inbox resource likely harm good mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give names callers arent allowed request specific responders much healthier safer callers develop relationship agency whole analogously much safer healthier ops develop relationship community whole even trained responders generally allowed work highintensity situations alone partly availability mostly wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue helper gets head someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality often comorbid depression escalate pm conversation much harder others including rdepression rsuicidewatch moderators help contrary common assumptions moderators cant see police pms observation many years people say pm consistently ones least understanding mentalhealth issues mentalhealth support gaps knowledge ability communicate effectively community input mitigates limitations theres reason someone whos truly help would want hide responses community scrutiny helpers concerned privacy keep mind selfdisclosure used supportively feelings details problem use altthrowaway accounts restrictions account age karma know internet used people exploit abuse others people want hide deceptive manipulative responses everyone except victims many specifically target vulnerable mentalhealth issues helper invites op talk privately gives good supportive experience theyve primed person vulnerable abusers sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someones state mentalhealth crisis people rely heuristics critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might best option although dont recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want please keep expectations realistic careful look history anyone offers pm opening,2367,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,Positive,High Risk

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

I'm not the best at writing or explaining my feelings, so my story may be all over the place.

I'm miserable. I haven't been happy with how my life has been going since the start of high school. I was so bad at communicating in real life to the point where I was always trying to avoid starting a conversation with anyone. It astounds me that I was able to make a couple friends. I was constantly procrastinating and putting things off, whether it's schoolwork or my future. I barely went to school events or after-school activities, and spent most of my free time playing online games, keeping some sort of communication with my few friends.

When I finally got to college, nothing changed. In fact it got worse. I decided to pursue an engineering degree because I didn't know what else I was interested in and college applications were almost due. I started college during the pandemic, which may have been the loneliest time of my life. I had no roommate, no in person classes, and no friends. Since I had no synchronous classes, My sleep schedule pulled a 180 and I was eating my dinner when the food court opened at 6am. It got a little better the next year as an acquaintance from high school moved into my dorm, and we lived together until I graduated. I wouldn't call us close friends, but it was better than being alone. I realized I didn't want to be an engineer somewhere during my 3rd year, but felt like I owed it to my parents to graduate. So I continued. Throughout college, I've only met one person that I consider to be a friend that I made. Unfortunately I graduated around the time we started to hang out more, which really devastated me since I haven't made a friend since high school, and now I can't hang out with him since I lived out of state. When I graduated, I felt no pride or didn't feel like I achieved anything great. I don't feel like I took anything seriously enough and don't feel like I would be prepared for a job in the field, regardless of if I had good grades or not. My mom always said that college would be the best years of my life, and it pains me to think that I might have wasted it.

So now I'm home. It was at this point where I kind of self-destructed. I stopped eating and lost around 25 pounds in a couple months. I'm a big guy, maxed around 330, so maybe that's not too bad. I stopped playing video games, which was my life up until now. I now spend the majority of my life in bed with the lights off. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel comfortable in my own room anymore.

After reflecting on my life so far, I feel like my biggest mistake was not taking the time to find what I enjoy in life, and now that I'm at the time where I have to become independent, I feel like I will never have the chance. My social skills are still horrendous, I can't start a conversation with someone who doesn't have a similar interest. I can barely have a conversation even with my parents and I hate it. 

I love my parents. They always tried to do what was best for me and want me to succeed. After all the times they tell me they just want me to be happy, I can't help but feel miserable and guilty every time they bring up my situation. After all the opportunities they have given me, I still haven't made anything of my life, nor do I have a plan to.

3 Months after getting a degree in something I could care less about, and have made very little progress towards my future. I don't think I'll ever end it because I believe life goes on after I'm dead, and I can't do that to my family, but I just feel really lost right now. In my eyes, my future is being lonely and working a minimum wage job until I'm dead, and I'm ashamed that I don't have any bigger ambitions in life.

That's all I could think of. I'm not looking for pity, as I feel like I did this to myself. I'm looking for people who may have had a similar experience to me and how they managed to overcome it. This took me about 2 hours to write, but it feels nice to finally tell someone about it, rather than keeping it to myself. Feel free to ask questions.

1jliyoj,2025-03-28T06:26:33,I lost everything. Is my life redeemable?,"Two years ago I lost my mom to what I now believe was a suicide. I was only 22. I found her. I lived with her my whole life, in our apartment. Her landlords gave me 30 days to leave after I told them what had happened. I didn’t have a job, I didn’t have a mother, I didn’t have anywhere to go, I didn’t have any money. I ended up having to leave 90% of our belongings behind. I have severe PTSD from this experience that has left me with insomnia, crippling anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. 

I ended up moving into my dad’s house since I didn’t have anywhere to go. Growing up we didn’t really have a relationship and his house (that he shares with my estranged brother) is absolutely filthy. My brother leaves garbage and filth on the floors and kitchen table, countertops, bathroom, anywhere he goes. His dog pees and poops in the house. They both chain smoke cigarettes in the house. My dad works full time but my brother is 30 and doesn’t have a job, he just lives rent free and makes the conditions unlivable. You have to wear shoes in the house, it stinks, there’s cobwebs everywhere and dog hair and garbage and dirty dishes and food left out. 
I do not live this way. I live in my bedroom and only leave if i absolutely must use the bathroom or eat. My brother has never washed dishes a day in his life and expects me to. My dad and him are both extremely emotionally volatile so I avoid them the best I can and return to my bedroom as much as I can. 

The point of this post is that I am so depressed, traumatized, angry, hurt, and stressed that I have contemplated offing myself. I was in a horrific car accident a few months back that I survived, and that also left me with more PTSD and general unhappiness. I cannot afford to move out, I don’t get paid enough, there are no other jobs that will pay more. I have finally alienated all of my friends so I can be left alone for good. 

I’m starting to question if my life is redeemable. How do I get through this? I have lived here for two years now and I am completely and utterly alone. Everyone has someone: a boyfriend, a girlfriend, someone to constantly have and lean on. I don’t have that, I just feel like a massive burden on everything and everyone and don’t want to live anymore because it’s too much. I need help, I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to escape. Do I kill myself?

1jlgi0m,2025-03-28T04:31:55,thank you to anyone who reads this,"I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. I wish I had friends to go out with, people who would give me courage and experience life with me so I wouldn’t be so nervous. I know I can only blame myself, but I’m just so upset. I wish things were different for me.

Today, my sister told me that my mom wanted to talk to me about something, but she acted weird about it, like she didn’t want to say what it was about even though i kinda already knew. When I went to see what my mom wanted and sat on the couch, she started talking about how i will need to do more chores/cleaning now that my sister would be working soon and wouldn’t be home much anymore because of high school, college courses, programs, and work. I already figured that would happen. It just makes sense.

But then my sister came downstairs and just stood there listening, even though, to my knowledge, my mom had only asked to speak to me. It made me uncomfortable. Then my mom started saying how I don’t do anything, how she works, how my sister does a lot, and then asked, “Do you think taking on more chores is too much for you?” Like… what? Of course not. But the way she says it, I just sit at home doing nothing, hurt. I know it’s true, and I hate it. Every day, I feel sad about it. Every night, I think about it. But when I try to express that, my mom just says I’m being defensive. The way she talks down to me makes me feel so small, and my younger sister just stood there listening. Then my mom said the conversation was for both of us, but everything she was saying was directed at me.

I always wanted to go to college. Ever since I was 15, I dreamed about it. I’d watch YouTube videos of freshmen sharing their experiences and think, maybe someday that’ll be me. But it wasn’t. I spent the last few years of my life inside my room.

I had so many dreams traveling with friends, going out on holidays and summer breaks, visiting cafes and malls together but none of it ever happened. I didn’t make it happen for myself. I wish I had someone to do it all with, someone to push me, and I’d push them too. It’s less scary when you’re not alone.

But a huge part of why I feel this way, why I have so much anxiety, is because of my weight. I’ve been insecure about it for as long as I can remember, but now it affects me more than ever. I don’t even like going places because I feel ashamed, like people are judging me. I feel like I can’t live unless I lose weight. I wanted to be that beautiful girl in college, the one with friends and a life, but I’m not. I know I’m too sensitive, I know I lack discipline, and I know I’m not strong enough for this world. Each year, I lose more hope and waste more time. I only see myself getting worse i don’t think i can keep doing this i don’t see a future for me.

Depression,  cognitive decline, and loneliness has completely destroyed my life. I have isolated myself for the past year after falling into a deep depressive episode after one panic attack, and i have become a completely different person. I lost my job, and basically just sit on my ass playing video games and sleeping as much as possible hoping i don’t wake up. 

The worst part of this is the cognitive changes and the loneliness. I go days without even hearing another souls voice, and my memory and thinking ability is so impaired i can’t remember what i had for dinner yesterday and my mind is completely void of thought 24/7

Whenever i have tried to talk to people, i just can’t because i can’t think anymore and my personality is just gone. i don’t even talk to my parents anymore. i’m just like a zombie. I feel like my life is being wasted and i could have never imagined that life could get this bad.

I am scared to even step outside of my house anymore. Doctors have found nothing wrong with my brain and therapy/ medication has not worked. I think of suicide every day, any advice or encouragement would be appreciated because i am truly on the edge of life and death.

I feel like I’m absolutely incredible at masking. I’ve been on the verge of panic attacks every night before I sleep. 

Normally I’m someone who can’t sleep but recently it’s flipped, I sleep for 12, 14, 16 hours straight - I wake up passively suicidal. I go about my day passively suicidal. 

I sit in work on an absolute hair trigger, I think about how I can disappear, I have no motivation. 

I force myself to workout, to eat healthily, to show up to work on time. 

I just want to make the numbness and panic go away and I don’t know how. I’m desperate. I’m scared. I am completely alone. 

My friends come to me with their problems and I help, I talk them through things, I ease their anxiety. They tell me how proud they are of me and say how well I’m doing and all of it is a lie. 

I can’t do it for myself, I can’t open up. Therapy isn’t helping. Meds aren’t helping. I need to feel better, I desperately want to feel better. All I want is to feel better again. 

I don’t want to be a burden to anyone, I hate being the disappointment. 

I genuinely can’t do this anymore. I don’t know how to get out.

1jlfdmx,2025-03-28T03:43:53,I can't motivate me to do anything,"To get to the point, I'm a 27 yo guy without a job for almost a year, no money, lot of things I want to do but I don't do even when I have all the time in the world. Just waking up to eat, play videogames and repeat.

I feel awful, all days are almost the same, I can get distracted or entertained but can't achieve anything more than that. Send CVs from time to time, but no interviews or responses at all. I don't even want a shitty job to feel like they are draining me. But without one, I can't pay my now second broken teeth, get therapy, pay for the things I want and not be a burden like I am.

Luckyly I have a family, friends and that, who doesn't seem to give up on me but I feel like I'm just there, living on charity, surviving and getting advantage of what they earn. They all do things, make efforts and spend their time in a job but I can't get myself to do the same. And then they want me to go on dinner, make plans and have fun, things that I want to do but feel like I'm stealing the money from them, even when they know I cannot pay.

It's not better to just say ""no"" to them. But I did. I'm sure I should have done it earlier. When I was working, I thought that the abyss was far away, could pay for my things and that, but I'm again in this hole and I know how to scape but can't get myself to do it.

This is not what I wanted to write and feel more like a vent. I'm just trying to figure out what to do, how to get the motivation to find a job again, feel like a useful person and this time, get therapy for the first time in my life cause I feel is the only way to start improving and not getting myself in this same hole that is so comfortable yet so painful.

1jldoxi,2025-03-28T02:35:16,I can't stop blaming myself even if it was her cheating,"Last days I'm going through a hard time, my gf cheated on me and just threw me after that. So, in last days I have different emotions and things inside me and I'm trying to publish my feelings here in Reddit, sometimes it helps. This time not about what exactly happened. 

So, now I'm just sitting and thinking about what was in our last conversations. And I was literally just bullied. Whole time when I was begging her to stay and was ready to forgive, I just was talking like to a wall. She or just ignored all my words and just didn't answer on most things, or she was hating me. Like when she said something, I felt so much hate and anger from her. Also just passive, in emotions, and also just calling me an idiot, that I'm stupid and so on, these are just the easy ones.
But there's the point - I didn't do anything, it wasn't me who cheated, I was really begging her to stay, I was ready to forgive everything.
We never in more than a year had that in our conversations - we never called each other like that, we never shouted on each other, really never, we were able to talk. And go through by talking.
But in those 3 days I heard so much anger and 💩 to my side, I couldn't recognise her. He never did stuff like that, literally never, to anyone. But it all just falled on me.
And I wasn't shouting on her, I didn't make any scandal, I just tried to talk. Trough big pain. But talk. Like always. I didn't say anything bad, anything wrong, anything hating. Nothing. I tried to talk. But I got... Really waterfall of 💩 to my side. That would never happen, she never could do this, she couldn't literally kill an insect, she would hug it. But those days she... I don't know what did go in her head. Because she wasn't able do that. Never.
But I tried to stay calm and talk, I did this until the end, I didn't say anything hating to her side. I just couldn't. Because I loved and I love her. Something inside me just didn't let me hurt her and say something rude, even she did what she did...

And now I'm remembering this and I can't understand why did I deserve it? I know how she talked with her ex when he cheated on her and even then she didn't say and do what she did to me. I'm so disappointed, because I tried my best even in this situation. But I still got this 💩 even I didn't do anything wrong. Nothing was my fault. But in the end I was the person who was getting all the hate and all the rudeness. Why me? Why she decided to do like that after doing everything else, cheating on me? Why I just calmly ate it? Why I continue to love her? Why is everything like that, why did I deserve this? I can't understand. I really can't.

I'm so tired of this feeling. I didn't think in the start that for me it's so hurting, but after some time I understand that it's so awful. In the end I'm sitting and blaming myself that I somehow deserved it. Last time I also ended because the girl cheated on me. But it was like after ~2 months and I understood that that relationship was really unhealthy and I wouldn't want to continue even if she wouldn't cheat. But this time it's a freaking year. No problems like that at all before. Always talking. And then in one moment - cheating, anger, hate and so on. I'm so lost and disappointed. I'm blaming myself. It feels so hurting and I really don't know why I deserve it. Why all the time it's like that? I'm always doing my best, with everyone. But in the end no one cares. She cared truly for the whole year. And then in one day it turns like this. There is no hope left. I just want to end.

1jl8rev,2025-03-27T22:29:37,Is love enough?,"I constantly come to the conclusion that perhaps human connection, love, not just erotic love, any kind of love, is the solution to everything.

But I often see that many people struggle with depression and DONT feel lonely, and that to get a diagnosis for depression loneliness is not a required attribute , which kinda shocked me.

I thought having people close to you that fully understand you and can reach the deepest depths of your heart is enough to fix any mental illness, but I suppose it's not reality 

So perhaps even if I manage to get out of the loneliness and become more social my depression won't go away, which is a scary thought because so far I can't come up with another solution 

I keep trying to do the whole self improvement thing but I have absolute zero drive, I tried the ""look within you"" bs, but even my psychiatrist agreed that this isn't really true, humans need social connections, we need people, but what if this isn't the key to all of this either?

1ji2co9,2025-03-23T21:22:26,I've spent 90% of my freetime in bed since I was 12,"As the title says I've been bedrotting since I was 12. I spend most of my time laying in my bed. I can't sit upright in chairs because my posture is only used to laying in bed. I enjoy eating in my bed. I feel safe in my bed.

When I was younger I didn't spend all my time in bed because I had friends and activities to do. I could sit upright in chairs without being in pain. I don't know how to live like that anymore. It's been almost a decade since, I'm not familiar with it.

For fun I crochet in bed. I draw in bed. I watch videos in bed. I get a dopamine rush when I think about all the fun things I could do with my life. I fantasize about how good I would have it if I had friends and didn't rot away in bed everyday.

I don't know if this is hope or delusion. I make an effort not to lay in bed all day sometimes. But usually it's just so comforting to lay in bed because every other alternative is so strange and unfamiliar.

People tell me to just get out of bed, but I'm split between wanting to and not wanting to. I don't know what I'm supposed to do when not in bed. I could do what I do in bed while sitting in a chair instead. But then my neck and back hurts.

I could go for walks but I'm so tired, and nobody wants to walk with me. I could go alone but then I might as well just be in bed. I don't feel like I exist when no one sees me. My life is on standby. I can just rot because no one will judge me.

Don't get me wrong though. I don't want to have it like this. I want to be normal and be able to make friends and enjoy life outside of bed. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to. And everytime I try I end up feeling worse. I want to turn back and out of this lifestyle but I don't know how to.

No one helped me in the start. Now it's so much harder. But I don't feel like I can reach out for help. Everyone has it so much worse than me. I have it easy compared to most. I have reached out for some help, but I don't think they understand.

When I have to get out of bed I get ready in the bathroom. I look very presentable. I don't look like someone who can't get out of bed for mundane tasks. Because I show up to my appointments on time, clean and groomed.

I can get out of bed for the tasks I understand. I understand taking a shower and going to the bathroom. I understand ""hanging out"" the few times it happens. I understand having to be somewhere at a certain time. I understand eating when I feel hungry.

But I don't understand preparing a meal for mealtime or brushing my teeth in the morning and evening. Most of the time I forget, and other times I tell myself I'll do it the next time I get out of bed, only to forget. I don't understand self respect and getting out of bed for my own good. I only get out of bed for others. Now when I don't have others I don't know what to do

Maybe I just stay in bed because I really really hate myself.

I really just need a gun to get this shit over with quick and easy.


How the fuck is an anxiety riddled mess like me supposed to go to university? It’s not possible. I am terrible at making friends and that especially in real life. It has ended up with them just being school friends and nothing more.


This is actually bullshit. I wish I were normal, but I am not so the only solution is to just hang myself I guess.
I can’t keep up with normal people. I wish I could remove my amygdala or at least the right hemisphere of it so I wouldn’t feel fear.

1jjlsz2,2025-03-25T20:48:19,Guilty. Depressed. Suicidal.,"I'm a 21yo F, pretty good position in life otherwise. Studying to become a doctor. Not struggling academically. 

But adulthood hit me like a bomb. Since 3 years I've been through depressing times. Everything I do brings me guilt.

The thought of having my parents talk to me on call? Why'd they want to?

The eye contact with anyone? Oh shit I'm so sorry you had to see my face. 

Eating food? Do I even deserve this?

Asking for help when suicidal? Nobody deserves to hear this depressing stuff. Reddit is anonymous and helps me keep venting the pressure off and not blasting away.

I've still managed pass 3 years of my med school pretty much normally except the year 1 when I just couldn't understand what was happening. I asked for help back then. Idk if I got help or got scammed. I've probably taken every antidepressant in the books and my body is too sensitive to handle any of those side effects. I've been admitted so many times against my wishes. I've been through the horrors of ECTs against my will. Not 1 not 2 but 18 sessions. Since then I've had to pretend everything was more than normal and I was a very happy excellently performing student coping up with every damn thing. 

Today has been hard. Haven't been out of bed since like 8 hours. 2 days feeling like my breathing is so laboured. Anxiety shooting through the roof feeling like someone's about to take everything away from me. And obviously so much dissociation, I don't even feel alive and need to do anything to die.

1jisfpe,2025-03-24T20:19:14,Knowing That Suicide Is In My Hands Brings Me Peace,"For as long as I can remember, life has been an uphill battle. I’ve tried so hard, I’ve pushed myself further than I ever thought possible. But despite all the effort, everything still feels like it’s slipping away. **I feel like I’m cursed.** No matter what I do, no matter how much strength I muster, nothing changes. I don’t know if I can keep going on like this.

The only thing that seems to give me some sort of peace is knowing that I have control. **I can make the choice.** I know that suicide is in my hands, and that fact, strangely, brings me a twisted sense of comfort. The thought that I’m not powerless, that I still have some control over my fate, gives me something to hold onto. Even if everything else feels out of control, at least this one thing is mine.

But here’s the truth that I try not to think about: I’m so tired. I’m exhausted from pretending, from holding it all together. Sometimes, I don’t even want to be strong anymore. I just want the weight to lift, even if just for a moment.

I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me, and I don’t want pity. I just want someone to understand. I want someone to know how hard it is to keep going when it feels like the world is against you. And if someone can’t understand, at least I wish they could acknowledge the pain that never seems to end.

Lost my job because of her, I moved in with my grandfather not long after and started trying to rebuild my life. 

Everything was going alright until, a few days ago, we were out grocery shopping. While I was paying for the groceries, my Gramps walked out of the store to sit on the bench outside to wait for me because he had breathing problems and couldn't stand for long periods of time. As I came out of the store, I saw him getting attacked and robbed by a group of guys I don't remember how many. All I remember in that moment is just rushing in, no matter how many times I got knocked down I quickly stood up and shielded him from every attack. I probably could've taken out some of them if I fought back but I didn't want to risk moving from my position and my grandfather getting hurt so I just tanked the hits. Someone called the police and the attackers took off. I ended up blacking out for a bit, woke up with a broken nose, a few fractures in my face & news that the whole situation caused my grandfather to have a heart attack and die. 

My fractures were a little more severe than the doctor originally thought, so I was rushed to the trauma unit in another city almost an hour away because the hospital in my town is a none surgical hospital. Been here a few days. A police report was made and they're looking for the suspects. I have no faith in the police. Early this morning I got a call from my boss saying I'm fired. Even though I explained what happened, he didn't seem to care. Now I'm in the hospital healing, about to be homeless when I get out. Idk how long an enviction notice gives me but it'll be like a week or less until rent is due again and I'm trying to get discharged early to hopefully get bacl to my grandfather's apartment to grab what little clothes and stuff I have left and try to figure out my next move. With less than 36 and change to my name, no vehicle, no family, no friends and yhe coroner keeps asking what I want to do with the body, what funeral home, and all that sort of stuff. He didn't have life insurance, or a will, or anything in savings.

 I keep saying idk because I don't know because I just dont. I don't understand how to handle this, I never had to handle this. I feel stupid. Everyone expects me to have this whole situation magically under control, but I don't, I feel like a child. I'm so lost, I'm on my own. I understand I'm an adult, and I should just man up & just deal with it. But I'm so emotionally numb right now. I try so hard to be a good person. I just don't understand why bad things keep happening. I can't seem to catch a break. I feel so broken that I can't even bring myself to cry over my grandfather's death for some reason. Does that make me a horrible person?  I know I should be freaking out about my financial situations and what's going to happen to me after I leave the hospital, but I'm oddly calm, and idk why. I apologize for the long post, I don't expect anyone to care or to even read all of this. I just needed to get my feelings out because there's no one else I can talk to rn.

1jhcg2v,2025-03-22T22:02:52,"My parents want to kick me out, I have €6 and no support what can I do?","Hey everyone,

I’m a 20-year-old guy, still living with my parents and my little sister.

My mom doesn’t work anymore; she’s always at home. She has mental health issues, like thinking everyone is out to get her.

To explain what kind of relationship I have with her: in the past, I fell into depression. We went to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me antidepressants. But she wasn’t satisfied with my diagnosis. She desperately wanted me to have bipolar disorder, even though I clearly didn’t. She took me to several other psychiatrists, lying about me so they would prescribe neuroleptics. She even tried to convince me that I was bipolar.

Then, she tried to convince everyone else that I was crazy and had anger issues, even though I obviously didn’t. She told people that if she was sick, it was only because of me. She even told them she was scared I was going to kill her in her sleep. My sisters took her side, and my dad didn’t care. When I talked to him, he just said, “But your mom is sick, you’re always messing with her, it’s your fault.” Even though I was just minding my own business in my room.

When she got tired of me, she would send me to the psychiatric hospital. We kept going until we ended up back at the first psychiatrist, who told her that being “sick of me” wasn’t a good enough reason to admit me to a hospital.

She was also an alcoholic when I was a kid.

Now you see what kind of mother she is. (My dad is no better.)

They always hated me. When I say that to my close friends, they always tell me, “Nooo, they don’t really hate you, they’re your parents.” But please believe me when I say they really do hate me for NO reason.

I’ve always been calm, introverted, and tried my best to please people.

Now, here’s what just happened, and it scares me.

First, you should know that I’m in student debt because they paid for my sister’s school but refused to pay for mine.

I stopped talking to my mom for a week because she wanted me to organize her medication. I said okay. It took two hours. And at the end, instead of thanking me, she looked at me with disgust and said, “Pff, I’m sure you hid Xanax in your pockets,” as if I were a drug addict. So I told her to apologize, or I would stop talking to her. She still didn’t.

This afternoon, I was just making an apple pie in the kitchen. I thought people would be happy about it, lol.

While I was doing it, she said stuff like, “Pff, I’m sure he’s doing it just to piss me off,” because usually, I’m not allowed to stay in the same room as her for too long, or she sees it as provocation.

Then, she suddenly stormed into the kitchen, crying and yelling because I added more dishes to the sink (even though I was going to wash them). She completely lost it, screaming that I was “doing everything I could to ruin their lives,” that “they couldn’t stand me anymore,” etc.

My apple pie needed ten more minutes in the oven, but she started shouting, “NO, I CAN’T WAIT TEN MORE MINUTES WITH YOU HERE! LEAVE THE ROOM!!!” I wasn’t even talking, just washing the dishes.

Then my dad told me I was making them crazy. I told him I was just minding my own business, and he said, “Maybe that’s the problem.” And he said to back up my bags and that by tomorrow I should not be in the house anymore 

Guys, whatever I do, they always have something to say. They just want me gone. He said they were going to kick me out. It reminded me of when my mom tried everything to send me to a hospital when I was too young to be kicked out.

⸻

Now, I know they really will kick me out.

I don’t know what to do. I have 6€ in my bank account. I’m in debt, and my studies take a lot of time. I tried to find a weekend job because I knew my situation at home was unstable, but I couldn’t find one. I’m so scared.

I also don’t have any friends that could help me. And I don’t have family because my mom fought with her entire family, so we haven’t spoken to them in years and years.

What do you recommend I do?

You might say I should work, and yes, I should probably keep looking for a job. But if I only work weekends, will I make enough to afford rent, food, and my 300€/month debt payments I'll have to start paying very soon?

The big problem is that I’m in med school, and my studies will last for a long time. I think I’ll get a (low) salary in my 6th year, but right now, I’m only in my 2nd year.

(Side note: I haven’t had a proper meal in more than a week because they don’t make food for me and won’t let me cook. I’ve just been eating garbage—cookies, snacks, whatever I can find. At school, I can’t eat lunch because I don’t have enough money in my bank account.)

1jgam82,2025-03-21T12:07:47,I hate myself and I hate everything,"Hello
I don’t know what’s the point of writing this and whether anyone is going to read it.
But I need to say it
I hate myself 
From a young age I knew I wasn’t attractive 
and people made sure I knew
I remember my father trying to cover my big forehead with my hair when I was 7
I remember him telling me to get inside and to stop playing with the girls because “you’re too old” when I was the youngest of the group.
I remember friends making fun of my looks in high school, “I’ve never seen a nose bigger than yours”
“Baldie” , “you have no eyelashes”

I remember my sister telling me I look like in my thirties when I was only 18
I remember when we were swimming and as my sister was taking pictures of us I asked her to only take a picture of me if I look good, she looked through the camera and said no you don’t look good. Her face looked very sorry 

I met someone a few months back, she mistook for my older sister who’s 15 years older than me.
And she actually said you look more like your older sisters 

I got married a few years ago and a few months after we got married my husband told me he didn’t find me attractive first but got used to it 
I cried so much after that and I kept crying every time I remember that
We don’t even have sex that often , even in our honeymoon and I know that that is because I’m ugly
I hate hime for that
I wish we didn’t get married 
But we have a baby now

My baby is really cute and im glad she is
I don’t want her to feel the way I felt my whole life
Some people commented on how cute she is and I asked does she look like me, all of them said Noo! 
It hurrtssss

I hate myself
I hate everything about me
Inside and outside 
I hate the way I think
How depressed i am

I don’t want my baby to grow up with a mother like me
I don’t know how to make it right 

I tried therapy for years. it didn’t work for me
I tried burying myself in work
I tried being positive and doing hobbies 
I tried everything 
Every thing

I don’t know what to do

I’m getting uglier by the year
I lost half of my already thin hair after having the baby
You could see my scalp from a million miles away

I gained 30 kgs

My body is covered in body acne and stretch marks
We barely have sex anymore 

Part of the reason is that i hate myself and don’t want my husband to look at my body 
And he doesn’t even initiate any form of intimacy that leads to that

I stopped taking care of myself because I have done that, and look where it led me.

Every night I go to sleep I pray I never wake up
Not because I’m ugly on the outside , but because it’s even worse in my head.

1jj4bp3,2025-03-25T04:14:12,From six-figure drug dealer to broken addict to finding life again—my story,"I want to share this because someone here might be where I was, feeling stuck, hopeless, drowning in silence, and maybe too ashamed to ask for help. If that’s you, maybe this will help.

I didn’t grow up with much. By middle school, I was selling weed just to survive. My parents couldn’t afford much, and I hated asking them for things they didn’t have. By high school, I was making about $90 a day, and it felt like a fortune to a teenager. But it just kept growing.

When I got to college, things took off. I built a network across campuses and back home. By sophomore year, I was pulling in $400 net profit daily. I built up a solid operation over the years, growing my customer base through Snapchat, which became my full-time storefront. By what should’ve been my senior year, I was making around $200,000 profit annually, not in sales, but pure profit.

I had workers, a lawyer on retainer, my own apartment, two cars, a Camry for blending in and a tuned Mercedes E53 AMG for speedy weekends. I even helped pay a chunk of my parents’ mortgage. They thought I had a booming drop-shipping business. They were skeptical, but proud. On paper, I was winning. In reality, I knew I should stop this soon.

Then came the first big wake-up call.

One day, I was set to make $20,000 profit on a single delivery. My parents were visiting and accidentally blocked my Camry in, so I took the E53 AMG. Bad choice. I got pulled over for the exhaust because it was tuned. The cops saw part of a mushroom bag peeking from under the seat. I refused a search, but they brought in the dogs. They found half a pound of cocaine, multiple pounds of weed, Molly, LSD, and shrooms.

I was sure I was done. But my lawyer, one of the top guys for drug cases in my state, worked his magic. It cost me a lot, but the charges were dropped completely. I walked out of court free, but with a hole in my pocket. At that time, I was already using Percocets occasionally, just to take the edge off, but it wasn’t an everyday thing yet. Still, instead of seeing the arrest as a warning, I went right back to business.

Then the raid happened.

A few months later, my apartment door got kicked in by DEA agents and my local police department. They found my stash, scales, packaging, the whole setup. My lawyer came through again and got me probation, but this time it wasn’t just the legal system that shut me down.

The DEA and my town’s police department worked together to get my Snapchat account permanently banned and were strictly supervising my social media accounts. That was my entire pipeline. I had built that online business for 8 years, growing a customer base that reached far beyond my city. It was all gone overnight. No backup account, no reboots.

At that point, I took it as a sign from God to stop. I just gave up. I wasn’t even motivated to try rebuilding. That’s when the depression fully took over.

Suddenly, all the noise in my life, the deals, the adrenaline, the constant movement, it went silent. And when it got quiet, I was left alone with myself, and I hated what I saw. I felt like I was floating in this empty space, disconnected from everything. No purpose. No identity. Just a hollow version of the person I used to be. It’s like I was alive but invisible, nobody could really see how broken I was inside.

I’d lie in bed staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep, unable to move, just replaying all my failures over and over. The room would feel smaller every day, like the walls were closing in, suffocating me. I was surrounded by people who cared, but I felt more alone than I ever had. I didn’t want to be alone, but I also didn’t want anyone to see me like that. I isolated myself because I thought I deserved to suffer.

I’d have moments where I’d get up, thinking, “Maybe I’ll get it together today,” but within an hour, the weight of it all would slam me back down. I felt paralyzed, mentally and physically. The shame, the regret, the anger at myself, it sat on my chest like a truck. I couldn’t even look in a mirror without feeling disgust.

And that’s when the percocets started becoming a daily thing. What used to be occasional turned into dependence. Within a couple weeks, I was spending $250 to $500 every two days on pills. In less than a year, I threw away $80k just trying to numb my self

When pills got too expensive, I turned to heroin. I couldn’t believe I was snorting heroin, something I swore I’d never touch. But it was cheaper, and by that point, I didn’t care. I was desperate for numbness. I just needed relief, relief from the crushing guilt, the loss of control, the emptiness.

My parents watched me turn into a shell of who I once was. They didn’t understand how their son went from helping with their mortgage to locking himself in his childhood bedroom, barely eating, barely speaking, wasting away in front of them. They tried everything. Rehabs, tough love, soft love. Every time I relapsed, I could feel their hope slipping further away, and that only fed the darkness.

I hated myself. The self-loathing was unbearable. I felt like I had shattered my life beyond repair. I would scroll through old pictures of better times, and it felt like looking at a stranger. I didn’t recognize myself anymore. Every time I saw someone from my old life thriving, moving forward, I sank deeper. I felt stuck in quicksand, watching the world pass me by.

After years of this cycle and three stints in rehab, I was still an addict. The shame, the isolation, the self-doubt, it was like living inside a prison I built for myself. I didn’t want to die, but I didn’t really want to live either. I was just existing. Like a ghost haunting my own life.

Then my parents booked a trip overseas for the family. It was about six months away, and I told myself I’d somehow cut down so I wouldn’t go into full withdrawals on the trip. But I couldn’t taper fast enough. When we left, I was withdrawing hard, sweating, vomiting, trembling, trapped in my own skin. If you’ve ever felt opioid withdrawals, you know, it feels like your body and soul are tearing apart. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 

The first few weeks were pure agony. We tried to find help, but the medications I needed weren’t easily available in that country. By some miracle, in the third week, we found a doctor who got me something that eased the symptoms. It wasn’t Suboxone (the actual withdrawal medication) but it was enough to help me eat again and function. I was still weak, still broken, still crying silently at night, but somehow, I kept going.

When we came back home, I blocked my dealer’s number and flushed everything I had left. I’ve been clean ever since, over a year now. 

Looking back, the raid might’ve saved my life. Had I kept going, I probably would’ve ended up in prison, shot in a deal gone bad, or overdosed alone in that apartment.

Six months into my sobriety, I started feeling that tiny spark again, the faint feeling that maybe, just maybe, there was still a future for me. I re-enrolled in college, and now I’m working toward my degree.

The hardest part wasn’t the arrests or the money lost, it was the quiet war with myself. The suffocating depression. The loneliness so heavy it made the air feel thick. The self-hate that made every day feel like a punishment. But I’m proof that even from that place, it can get better, little by little.

If you’re struggling right now, just know this, even if you feel like you’re at the bottom, even if you’re too ashamed to ask for help, even if it feels impossible, there’s still a way out.

I 27 female have had depression for over 10 years. Been diagnosed had therapy, medication, attempted, the lot. I slip in and out of it and idolsation.

I recently had a close friend lose a family member through suicide. And the grief that follows is awful. I wasn't close or had much contact with their family member, but seeing the aftermath. It's not worth it. It's never worth it. I've recently had an enormous amount of guilt about the fact I ever tried to take my own life. The thought that I could have done that to my friends not even my family but my friends. To think that I could have put that weight on their shoulders. 

Honestly you think in that moment that your suffering should end. I'm telling you now it's never ever worth it. I know when I was low I would tell myself no one would care, no one would mind if I did it. But after seeing this I'm telling you the people that you would affect after you're gone, you could never imagine.

Keep going you got this. From a girl who's been in the pits and kept pushing on and getting better you can to. I just had to get this off my chest somehow.

I have distanced myself and ghosted peers, friends, and family. Just recently, finally broke up with my partner and they were pretty much the last string I needed to cut before I go away for good. I wanted to eliminate every hope and help I could get because I simply don't deserve it. I stopped making any plans in the near or far future, except for this.

I wanted to give everyone a clean slate. I would do it outside my city/hometown, in an apartment no one knows I even live in. Pack my stuff like I'm moving out. Prepped the letters and even goodie bags for my loved ones filled with my belongings and gifts that I wish for them to have afterwards. 

I've felt like this for a year now. I've been waiting for it to pass because that's how it should be right? but it hasn't. It's only gotten worse and as each day passes, I'm more sure of this decision. I've imagined my plan in my head almost every night. In a matter of days, it'll all be over.

No one knows any of this. There's days where I'm itching to tell someone but I always back out at the last minute. I'm just scared to feel some sort of hope again and all the progress I've made to planning my death, will all be for nothing.

I love my family, friends, and ex boyfriend. I'm sorry for pushing you all away the past 2 months. I'm just so tired. Please don't be angry that I didn't come for help.

Last night I had a full on breakdown out of nowhere. I just bawled my eyes out because I felt so tired of everything. It is like the weight of everything just came crashing down. 
It was some sort of grief as well. Like I am grieving the person I was suppose to be at this age. But also grieving for the younger me who had so much hope and dreams, who had so much spark and drive. As I am typing this I want to start crying again. It is a type of pain I have never felt in my life. 

My life is not bad at all. I have a job, a partner that loves me so much, healthy family, a safe apartment, friends, loving cats, my health. I have everything. But I am just not happy at all. I do have great days where I have the best time but even then I don't truly feel happy or satisfied. I laugh and smile but deep down I just don't feel the emotion. I feel nothing. I try really hard to feel that happy/satisfied emotions, but I just don't feel it anymore. It scares the shit out of me. 

I have so many big things happening for me this year and coming years, but I feel nothing. I am set to get engaged, have an opportunity to travel abroad (never been abroad), getting a promotion, finish my studies, starting a new life and I feel absolutely NOTHING. I don't feel joy or excitement or any good feelings. I just feel overwhelmed with it all. It's like I can't see myself experiencing any of the above things, not because I don't want it but I just don't feel anything towards it. I always wanted these things since I was a teen and I feel like I am disappointing my teen self for not feeling what I thought I would be feeling. Like I am letting myself down. 

I try to find joy and peace in things that used to make me happy but it just doesn't do it for me anymore. I have been low, but this is a new rock bottom for me. I just want it all to end but I don't want to die because I know what a privilege it is to experience life. So, I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I am dreading this day and every single day. I just want to lay in a dark room and hopefully pass away in my sleep or something. 

Every day I am just on autopilot. Like I am seeing my life just pass me by and I am not able to keep up with it. It is extremely exhausting. I lost my passion for my work and don't give one shit about working towards a promotion. I used to be such a driven and hardworking student in my teens/20s but now studying again I just don't feel that drive and motivation. I don't care to graduate or work hard at all. I have the opportunity to travel abroad and I have never been abroad, but I don't care to even go. An opportunity that I would've killed for as a young adult. I just don't feel that excitement because I know it won't change anything. I will feel the exact emptiness and it would just feel like a wasted moment. I have an amazing partner who wants to start his life with me and I love him so much, but I don't feel like I would be excited to plan a wedding or feel the excitement my female peers feel. I don't dream about my wedding or my wedding dress, etc. I used to but now it feels all pointless. 

It all feels pointless. I wish I never existed. I wish I died when I was at my peak. Atleast I would've died knowing that I was happy living life. Life had so much meaning back then.

But anytime he mentions instances of him having sex—such as tonight, when he said he was going to—I have to fight every rude impulse in my body to be kind and supportive. It's not right to act this way or feel this way. I'm a 20 year old guy, and my friend is 23. I'm a virgin. Have never done so much as hold a hand or look someone in the eyes with romantic intent. So obviously it's going to be a raw subject.

But god, why is it _so raw?_ It hurts when he talks about it. Physically. I feel physical pain and anxiety. I don't feel this way about anything else. It fucking sucks. And I don't want to tell him that it hurts me, because the whole point of our friendship is that we're very honest about what's going on. If I just deny him an entire segment of his life as a boundary... idk, it feels shitty. Like I'm being shitty.

I will never be loved, I will never know anything but unrequited love, I will never hug anyone, never go on a date with anyone, andvI will die alone. I will never make any friends, I'll never have real friends, I'll never know what it feels like to be wanted by anyone. I'll never know what it feels like to be enough for anyone or anything.

I'm tired of trying to push on and hope things get better, because they never do. Things just get worse and I can't take it anymore.

I just want to end it all. 
I'll never be enough to even make a single friend, and I'll always end up alone. I'll never get a partner because that takes time, and the longer something takes, the more likely I am to make some stupid mistake and fuck it all up.

I (24F) have been depressed for years stemming from the death of my father at 10 yrs old & more loved ones down the way. In 2021 I got involved with an abusive guy for 2 hellish months & im lucky to have survived it at all. I’m still scarred from this. In 2022 my brother & sister in law got in a big argument with me that turned violent and this was in front of my nephew, his son who tried to protect me.

In short, fear of death & conflict has taken over my mind. I’ve been in therapy since 2021 and matured a lot but it’s not working anymore. The ruminations are getting worse, my grandmother passed in December and i can’t stop crying everyday.

In short.. how do you defeat ruinations? Mine are bad. I’m constantly picturing myself having to fight over and over again or someone trying to hurt me. I’m a really kind person who has been “burned” many times before and it’s left me scared, sad and now angry.

I’m becoming angry and mad. I play shooters to let it out but I never used to rage this hard before. I know I must be unrecognizable to my boyfriend and I snap at him so much now. I don’t want to keep hurting him and I’m scared I’ll hurt myself as I’ve thought about suicide way too many times in the last 2 years

1jijk83,2025-03-24T10:58:01,Please. I feel so lost. This can't be how life is.,"Hello, I'm currently in my first year of high school. I've done pretty well so far, and I was one of the best students in the middle school. 
But this year has taken a toll on me. Badly. I've felt so disconnected from everything and everyone. My friends don't understand me or care. My only friends at school have adopted horrible beliefs. Disgusting beliefs I don't agree with, and most of society wouldn't either. But I can't abandon my friends. I can't go looking for new ones. I live in a rural area in the Midwest, in a tri-state area. Everyone at my school is the same way as my friends. I hate it. 
I dread school, even when I'm a good student. I feel no purpose anymore. In middle school, people liked me. My teachers would tell me I was creative and nice. I kept those words to heart. But I never get recognized anymore. The teachers talk to the popular kids. And yes, I've gotten to the point where when a teacher talks to me, I feel excited. 
Nobody ever starts a conversation with me. I don't blame them. I never talk at school. I've been 6 feet tall since 5th grade. I've been acne covered since 5th grade. Hell, in 5th grade our school had construction, and some workers said I didn't belong in the line. I was just going to art, and they said that to me. I was 10, and told by adults that I didn't fit in with my friends. That's always stuck with me. My 5th grade teacher said I sounded like a man, and it would unease her. Why did I have to be like that so early.
And because I went through puberty so early, I've gotten more mature than my peers. I can't connect. I can't socialize.
Therapy doesn't work anymore. I stopped taking my medicine months ago. I've gotten addicted to things. I feel disconnected from my own family. Is this what life is? Will I be like this when I graduate? Is there really no happiness to be found? Please. Help me. I don't want to cry anymore. I don't want to hurt anymore.

That one bitch traumatized me so much that even if I just start thinking about making new friends I think she’s gunna show up and just ruin everything again. 

I hate meeting new people bc everyone’s go- to conversations have to do with the weather or politics or what’s happening in the world. 

Hard to hold down a job bc I simply don’t give a single shit about bringing in more money for billionaire corporations that refuse to pay anything more 15 bucks an hour even if you have a degree and all that other bs stuff. 

Tried to start a business but again, bunch of ppl I used to be friends with would just post all over my website shitty reviews and stories about how I’m “such a shitty worker and anyone would regret choosing me” so all my efforts of running 3 different businesses were ruined by them. 

Now everyone has everything they ever wanted and I’m 1 month away from living in a box on the sidewalk. Don’t tell me everything on the internet is fake- they’re all married, they all have houses, careers, outtings with their friends once or twice a week. I don’t care if they’re in debt doing it, I WISH I had the opportunity to do and have all those things. It’s fking stupid but yea, I wish I had the means and opportunity to be able to go in debt. 

I worked my absolute ass off for 14 hrs a day for 10 yrs straight to be able to buy my dream car and house. It’s all I wanted. But some soulless man fired me for being a girl and then shit talked my name so hard no one in my area would even hire me anymore. I had to dump all my savings into staying afloat and being able to survive. I’ve lost everything more times than anyone can even comprehend, and most people I vent to tell me to get over it like my life is a goddamn sandwich. 

What goes around comes around is absolutely the biggest bs lie I have ever heard in my life. All I’ve ever done is live my own life while also making sure everyone else was good. But ofc anytime I needed any kind of help at all every one runs in the opposite direction. 

I simply would rather die. I don’t even know why I’m here. My passions were ripped out of my hand like a baby holding a candy bar and my purpose seems to just be either everyone’s punching bag or the person that gives everyone else advice to put thEM back on the right track.

I feel like a part of me has given up, while another part is trying to drag me along and keep doing my work.

I cant keep chasing novel experiences but sometimes it feels like the only thing that makes me less depressed. 

My social life is basically dead, and I'm not sure how to fix it.
I feel so confused and numb most days, and a deep sense of sadness and frustration, also disconnect from the world in general.
I hate going outside because it reminds me of how lonely I am, feels like I'm trapped in a bubble and the rest of the world is trapped in theirs.

My brain is constantly yelling at me that there is no point when I do creative work, that I'm pretty much just wearing myself out and my work in general has become mind-numbing and repetitive because that's what's easiest.


I still get a small spark of joy for seeing my work complete, but it's a speck compared to what I used to feel, although I've been able to cry again lately, so that's a good sign.

I’ve been dealing with depression since I was 10…So basically half my entire life, add self harm and substance issues into the mix as well.

I had been doing so good since about 2023 after my last “attempt” and stopped sh completely as well. I got into a beautiful and healthy relationship and we’ve been together for over a year. I recently moved out of my parent’s house (I’m 20 now btw). I also have an amazing job in a hospital doing ect (no I don’t shock people’s fucking brains). 

For the past ~few~ months it’s been getting bad again, I didn’t think I’d start sh again but I failed that a couple weeks ago. I kept everything functional, I reached out when I needed it. I still go to work, take care of my cat and other household chores, as well as my relationships.

I still however feel an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I don’t feel like I’m meant to be alive and I’ve had this recurring thought since I was a kid. I never understood what being a human was like, I’ve always felt misunderstood and like an alien just wasting a spot on this earth. My birth wasn’t planned, nobody knew about me for two months, kind of ironic since I also grew up as a “glass child” with copious amounts of suicidal tendencies. 

I don’t belong, I can’t really connect with people as I want to. I’m drowning my days off work with smoking weed, nic, drinking shit vodka while popping a few kpins. On top of all this I’ve completely lost my appetite so I always just feel ghostly. I wouldn’t say I’m actively suicidal but god I hope someday I just won’t wake up.

1iwvbzn,2025-02-24T11:40:37,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

1jl1ib0,2025-03-27T16:46:42,Reminder to be careful with benzodiazepines.,"I'm not demonizing benzos or people who take them at all. I still safely take Xanax once or twice a week and it's extremely helpful for my panic attacks or just any type of severe anxiety I'm going through.  

I just wanted to remind everyone to be careful. I feel like some doctors aren't clear enough on how often you should usually take them if it's a permanent med you want to have in your life to take occasionally and ""as needed"". My doctor basically told me nothing when prescribing me Xanax as a teenager and it didn't go well because I used it everyday. It was complete HELL getting off of it.  

Long term consistent and everyday use can eventually cause addiction/dependency which is seriously one of the worst feelings in the world especially the withdrawal that can come with it. Severe withdrawal that happens from being dependent on larger doses can even be dangerous. 

Be sure to ask your doctor any questions you have before starting them. Like I said before I'm not trying to demonize benzos or anyone who takes them. Not looking to scare anyone either I just don’t want anyone to go through what I did as a teenager when I didn't know much about the topic before it was too late. 

Benzodiazepines can be an amazingly helpful tool and medication when used the right way. Just be careful friends that is all.

I had DPDR for many years due to my first incident with weed. This ruined me once and for all. I get panic attacks if I see someone 20 feet away from me smoking it. I tried drinking a very small amount of Kava for anxiety, which threw me into a panic episode of depersonalization. 

The only thing that has ever helped me was alcohol. And that’s that. There is really nothing else that comes close for me. Unless anyone else has any ideas. I am very afraid of most medications, but any ideas would be of help.

1jlg2q7,2025-03-28T04:13:45,My story of getting over anxiety and panic attacks hope this helps someone,"Hey,

So as stated above, I got over my anxiety and panic attacks (Sort of read more ). ( Male 25 currently )

  
Right, so a bit about me and my anxiety:

1. Had my first panic attack in 2023, which resulted in thinking I was having a heart attack and calling an ambulance. Imagine my surprise when I was told it was a panic attack, especially when the only anxiety I ever felt was during a presentation in front of a big crowd.

2. The first panic attack led me to call an ambulance for the next 6 nights, as it kept happening and I couldn't sleep at all during nighttime, and was confused about how to fix this.

3. The panic attacks then moved on from night time into daytime, which made me even more miserable, and after being sleep deprived for a month and getting depressed from this, I realised I had to do something.

  
**The process of understanding my panic attack process:**

1. The first thing I did was go at it symptom-wise. Once the panic attack starts, it spirals out of control into an ambulance call cause my brain says I am dying, help please. So did every test possible on my heart and other organs, including a brain, lung scan, and even checked for cancer just for fun. After getting all the results that no shit I am completely fine I was now reassured that I am not dying.

2. The panic attacks still happened constantly, but they stopped spiraling into an ambulance call, as now I was sure I was not dying, it just meant I had to suffer my brain going at 500 km/h for the next 30 mins until I fried myself out. So this was the next step I needed to fix to stop this process.

**The process of finding a ""cure"":**

1. This was the more difficult part as I was physically healthy it meant my mind was fucked. Now a psychologist seems like a scam in my head as they just read books, passed some test and got their shit license / or they don't even have one. I chose psychotherapy, meaning a medical specialist who can help me.

2.  The psychotherapist (from now on referred to as therapist for easier writing), during my first sit down that lasted always 60mins on the dot, asked one simple question what do I want out of this I explained I want to stop having panic attacks, she explained I can just take Xanax and be done with it. Which was a fair take, I had these drugs with me, I didn't like taking them as it slowed my brain down to such a point where I felt like a zombie. So she asked again What do I want to achieve with this? This time, after thinking for a few minutes, I explained I want to get my life back, meaning sleeping and enjoying life without thinking and anticipating that I am about to feel like I am dying. Now this was a small but very important moment in my battle with this new anxiety. She said this "" Your subconscious now has understood that there is a psychological problem,"" which she was correct in. This was not a disease like a common flu this was my brain saying hey somethings wrong fix it or i will keep fucking your life. After this I was now ready to start fixing my life.

**What is a panic attack?**

1. Panic attacks are your subconscious not agreeing with your conscious mind. Meaning my reality is going against everything my brain was programmed with from my young developing years. In total, I did 5 sessions 60 minutes each, 1 session per month. The reason for this was this explanation from my therapist:

"" Your subconscious takes 30 days to undergo a change, and you can only speak with it for 60 minutes. ""

**How do you speak with your sub-concious?**

My sessions went like this, a 5-minute. talk about how my life is going, if anything has changed, and then a 5-minute ""ritual"" more like guiding steps I have to do with my eyes close,d which would lead to a whole world opening in my mind. I would have these visions which I won't go into detail cause of course personal stuff, but your subconscious is so strong you can feel wind, water, heat, sadness, happiness,s and even pain while doing this. During my third session, I was able to not just see but also walk around instead of being just guided by my mind. Being able to stop and analyze was important. Now, if anyone is interested, I can explain in the comments the process to do this as I have been doing this as a party trick now, I just won't be able to explain what you saw, it's for you to analyze :D

**My last session, a 5-month result:**

After the 5 sessions, I have realised the life I was living was going against my mind and my brain was protesting against it now it's not something I can fix in one day after realising, but the 5 sessions in which my therapist pretty much just listened what I saw and wrote my panic attacks every month got less and less frequent. It's as if my two consciousnesses were now slowly starting to agree as there was more understanding of each other. This made them less frequent, but as i said in session 1 I want them fcking gone.

**After all this, this was the final fix:**

The final fix will sound stupid, but quote my therapist here:

""We have the ability to program ourselves and our minds, all you have to do is do it."" Now, if you told me this 5 months ago, I would have called this person a scam artist or a cult leader. But now feeling more in touch with my brain, I got to thinking, can I do it?

I asked my therapist for more sessions, he said this is the MAX amount any person should need, and this is it now, work on it. So I got home, the day went by, I kept thinking about it, and once again I went to bed I had a panic attack. Only this time, this was my thought process:

1. I am not dying

2 This is a panic attack

3. Why are you sending me this signal?

And during my third question in my head I felt an answer or a thought, I still don't know what it is, but I had a sudden impulse to go make green mint tea. I heated my water, I made the tea, I drank it panic attack was gone while I was making it. I thought, OK weird, the next day, same again. I go to bed, have a panic attack, I press the button to make the tea panic attack gone. 

And on the third day, I made green tea before going to bed, and I haven't had a panic attack since, except anxiety when I still have to present in front of a big crowd :P

**What the fuck is with this mint tea?**

Now, after all this, I called my therapist and explained the situation and asked if this was what she meant, should I just drink tea, is this some magical fix?

Now it turns out I have hyper brain activity, as most people do these days, it's not ADHD, it's just the brain always working very fast, it doesn't mean you can't focus. And my ""talks"" or ""meetings"" with my subconscious somehow made me understand that hey, let's make this ritual of making mint tea before we go to bed, which can cool our brain down, and also mint has a relaxing effect too.

  
**So mint tea = no panic attacks?**

For me, yes; for you, no. 

This story is about the process I went through to understand my condition and how I got in touch with my core consciousness. Since those sessions my outlook on life was clearer I was more happy and I was overall enjoying life more after every session even while I was still having panic attacks, so what I recommend to you is going to a psychotherapist a real doctor and trying this method out or just thinking about this on your own as I still have a habit of speaking to my self when I am laying in bed just mimicking a discussion and see if any bad thoughts come up.



If you read all of this, I hope this helps you somehow, and don't settle for just taking medicine, you are just avoiding and suppressing your mind instead of fixing it.

1jlipgf,2025-03-28T06:14:01,I’ve become a chronic procrastinator because of anxiety and I have no idea how to get better.,"I’ve become a chronic procrastinator because of anxiety and I have no idea how to get better.

It seems like almost every single tiny task I’ve got to do spikes my anxiety, whether it’s homework, organizing my room, doing projects, etc. I feel pain in my chest area, my breath shortens and my brain goes into a massive stress response.   

I think this all started during the pandemic, but it’s gotten significantly worse over time. I’m a college student now and things are starting to get pretty serious, yet I feel like I’m in the least productive phase of my life. Honestly, apart from going to classes, I do nothing all day. I don’t even party, read books or watch shows.

I’ve tried every possible trick that gets mentioned online, but none of them have worked for me. Seriously, I can’t count the number of times I have tried using Pomodoro or splitting tasks into tiny parts. This doesn’t work because I can’t manipulate myself into thinking I only have to do small part of assignments – it’s fairly obvious I must complete them.

I’ve also tried dopamine detoxes (they don’t work because my anxiety very quickly gets overwhelming and I can’t live without my coping mechanisms). I also tried reward systems, but they don’t work because I’d just rather not do my tasks even though there’s a reward (then, after a while, I just take the reward without doing the work). I’ve also tried hypnosis, visualizations, ‘forgiving myself’, gamifying, temptation bundling, meditation etc.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this on Reddit, I know nothing is going to change anyway. Maybe my problem is thinking anyone on the Internet has a solution to my situation.

I don’t have access to therapy right now. The consultations with my Uni’s psychologists occur on campus, in an empty classroom, and I’m afraid people will see me going there and think less of me.

Also, please don't say 'it sounds like you have x mental disorder'. That doesn't really help.

1jl5vkb,2025-03-27T20:28:05,Anxiety is a pot of boiling water,"My therapist had the best analogy for anxiety that ACTUALLY helps me view it better when I'm in the midst of heightened anxiety:

  
Your anxiety is like a pot of boiling water on the front burner. When it boils over - the water has gotten too hot and you are not in control (ie an anxiety or panic attack). 

  
The goal of 'controlling' your anxiety isn't to forget about it. It's to take the pot of water and put it on the back burner. That water is still there and it's still hot. and it could boil at any point - but it's on the back burner cooling. 

Things like therapy, medications, walking, deep breathing, exercise, healthy food etc. (whatever works for you - anxiety is a tricky thing) cool the water down and/or help it stay cool. 

Spiraling thoughts, alcohol, missing out on sleep, caffeine, etc. are things that may warm that water back up. 

And the goal of anxiety management is to be aware of the pot - not to ignore it - and to work on keeping it cool. 

  
\^ This analogy has seriously helped me view my anxiety as a thing. and something I can actively 'work on the temp'. And I explained this analogy to my partner and now we have a common language for how I'm feeling. 'The pot is hot today' vs 'feelin luke warm - its a good one today'. 

  
Hope this helps someone. I was surprised at how much it helped me.

I grew up quite confident. Never had anxiety issues or something. I was only ever insecure about my looks and had some abandonement and attachment issues but that never affected anything but my romantic relationships. Doesn’t really matter for the story.

Then, when I was 21 I got IBS out of nowhere and my life just went straight to hell. Failed year after year of uni, was too afraid to go outside at one point, got severly depressed and anxious. 

I managed to get my degree and managed to land a job I like that’s also hybrid. And I still feel like wanting to die everyday because the anxiety of leaving the house and going to work is too much. I worry all the time. I worry that my IBS will act up at work, I worry I’ll get fired for using more days WFH than what we are contractually allowed. I talked to my managers about my issue and they said that it’s no problem if I need more days from home some weeks, but that didn’t lessen my anxiety.

I’ve achieved exactly nothing in my life and my every day is a battle with anxiety from the moment I wake up. I lash out at people who love me because I feel like a trapped animal only the trap is my body so I can never get away from it. I feel like such a burden on my mom, who gave me everything she could only to have to listen to me say on daily basis that my life is just one big struggle and I’m not happy and want to be dead. 

If I stay alive, I’ll just burden and wear out all people who love me. They are so worried and I am so mean. I keep telling them that more time with them is no longer enough for me to deal with life and that I want to rest. I keep thinking I’ll never be fully independant let alone be able to actually take care of someone else. Of my parents, when they get old, of a child some day… I can’t take care of myself… 

I just want to end it because I feel like I’m doing all I can to be a functioning adult and still failing miserably. 

I’m in therapy, it’s not helping. I tried meds, they do help, but not longterm and they make me sleep all the time and gain weight. I tried journalling, I have multiple hobbies, I try, I try, I try. And my life still seems reduced to anxiety of getting out of the house… I’m so tried and I feel so guilty for being like this. 
I know no one wants to lose the person they love, but I often feel that if I killed myself, my family, my friends, my partner, they would lose me once and mourn me.

Hi everyone. 
Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. I almost immediately noticed a loss of interest towards my hobbies. 

Ever since then it’s been a living hell. Up until February i was having bad panic attacks, i worked on those with a therapist and i’m now doing much better under that aspect. 

What hasn’t changed, and has worsened honestly, is the complete disinterest i have developed for all of my hobbies and life in general. The most i do is go to work, force myself to go work out, and sit on the couch with my gf, then go to sleep. 

I have lost all interest in editing photos, in taking photos, in posting them, in going to events where i can take them. I lost all interest in going out with my friends and acquaintances. I just feel so empty and unmotivated. I believed it was winter doing its thing, but the seasons are changing and my situation is mostly the same. I have even lost interest in sex. I am eating the same two foods for every meal. I don’t even find enjoyment in playing on my pc anymore, i bought myself a brand new pc for Christmas and have used it a few hours at most. I spent more time setting it up and building it vs the time i actually used it. 

I am getting tired of living like this, but i just feel so unmotivated to do anything, i lost all my drive and i’m just waiting to be better, waiting for the physical pains to go away, waiting for my mind to stop being so on edge. 

I miss my old self and have no idea how to get it back. I miss driving for hours to go to events and take photos there, i miss the late nights with friends, i miss being able to just go to a restaurant on my own and enjoy myself, i miss going out with my girlfriend and living our lives. I miss the person i was a few months ago, i feel like i’m just a shell of my old self, as if i’m running on power saving mode. And it only makes everything worse. 

Please share some advice if you can. I don’t know where i’m headed. 

Edit to add: I quit in order to become healthier, not because i had problems regulating myself. I'd smoke weed in the evening before bed (3/4 puffs) and on sunday morning (a bit more). As for alcohol, i was drinking to the point of being drunk once per month, tipsy twice per month. With the occasional beer here and there.

So far that has been a success and I was confident to try a new food- so I did and I was almost convincing myself that my throat was closing. Obviously I was fine but it’s so frustrating. And this fear extends beyond food. I was given as needed hydroxyzine that I have yet to try due to fear of an allergy. 

I feel very alone and frustrated. I was wondering if anyone else had struggled with this and overcame it? Or if there is anyone else out there that has a similar struggle so I don’t feel so alone.

1ji5iw1,2025-03-23T23:36:46,I can't stop feeling extremely anxious about death.,"Hey guys. I posted a couple days ago RE struggling with recurring panic attacks and nocturnal panic attacks. They have made me physically and mentally exhausted. My soul feels tired. They have also abruptly shook me to my core and made me come face to face with the fact that I am going to die. The panic attacks would come and my brain would say, ""you're going to drop dead."" And now that thought is on loop. It makes my head fuzzy. I do yoga, I eat well, I run, I live in nature, I tend to a garden, I get outside the house every day, I live with others, and none of its helping. I feel like my brain is inflamed or sick because the thoughts are so intrusive. I used to live my life in anticipation of the future, or thinking happy memories in the past, but it's like something shook me so strongly and reminded me that all we really have is now and that realization is sobering. I am grieving everything I have lost and will lose.

I keep thinking about how everyone I love will die. All the beautiful birds I watch every day, they will die. The opossum under my bird feeder at night will die. My precious cats will die. It makes me so anxious to the point where I am genuinely feeling ill 24/7 and I cannot go anywhere or do anything without this constant anxious panic about death.

I assume most humans think about mortality but it is making me depressed and sad. I have been a generally happy person and I love life, but I feel like I've been mentally hit with a weight that just won't lift. I am a lover of nature and environmentalist and have always found so much awe and beauty in nature but now when I look out at the trees or the creeks I just see my own reflection of sadness and the constant anxiety I've lived with my whole life.

Why do we have to die? It doesn't bring me peace knowing my atoms will dissipate, it makes me sick. All I know is right before me, and all I know will be stripped away into nothing. So what is the point? What are we doing here? It feels like a sick game, and humans have gone so far off the rails that everything in our society seems like it is just some unhealthy coping strategy. 

I look at strangers and think of how fleeting their existence is too. I think about all the terrible ways humans treat each other and the Earth and my heart is just so full of grief for the amount of suffering I am witnessing. I literally cannot even look at lobster tanks in the grocery store without wanting to bawl my eyes out. The worst part is that death is starting to sound peaceful because at least I won't have to think. But I love thinking and I don't want to die. I keep imaging myself screaming and crawling during my final days and all I see is terror. It makes me think about the blackness after death. We don't even experience death. What if its because of the sheer terror of it all? Ugh. It makes me sick.

I am only 28 and I want to live a long and happy life, but this is by far the hardest experience in my life I've had to go through. I'm just so sad. I am crying all the time over my own death and the death of us all. I have isolated myself from society and I know that doesn't help. Is this just depression? Anxiety? PTSD?

1jg95pp,2025-03-21T10:27:07,My mom may have cancer,"
So my mom had blood work done and her WBC was 22. We thought maybe it’s a fluke, she got retested two weeks after and now it’s 37. And all her markers are up for white blood cells.

I’m positively devastated and my OCD and anxiety is flaring so bad- I can’t stop googling even though I know it’s bad. And I can’t stop blaming myself- thinking it’s God punishing me for needing my mom so much and having to move home as an adult for my mental health and now she’s going to be taken from me. Or that I didn’t appreciate her enough.

My therapist says I need to accept the possibility that people can get sick and die- and it’s not like I don’t understand that or don’t rationalize that. She tells me I can’t control my mom’s health and the course of life and I KNOW, god I know.

But my heart is broken and not having control to fix this and the idea of losing her and watching her get ill makes me want to curl up in a ball and disappear. 

I’m dying inside. I feel like I can’t breathe or think. 

Like normally my OCD and anxiety stuff is health stuff that is really irrational or even if it happened I’d be okay. And I’ve been doing so good with ERP, but the doctor throwing out leukemia and her results and my mom crying and being devastated. How am I suppose to cope with that reality, to accept that reality- that I could lose her? How I suppose to survive that?

She’s my best friend, my biggest comfort, my greatest
Joy and the most incredible mom in the world. My dad isn’t really a good person and my brother and I used to be close but his fiance doesn’t like me very much. So I feel like I have no one to turn too and like my life will just shatter and never recover if she dies. 

And I’m mad at my therapist for being like you have to accept bad things can happen- I know that for the love of god I know that. But it doesn’t mean that it’s not absolutely devastating and it shouldn’t be I just have to sit there and accept it. I just don’t know what to do. 

I know her results are really bad as someone who is studying medicine (not enough knowledge to diagnosis) so I just feel like I’m waiting for that shoe to drop with the diagnosis and just waiting to lose her",anxiety,mom blood work done wbc thought maybe fluke got retested two weeks markers white blood cells im positively devastated ocd anxiety flaring bad cant stop googling even though know bad cant stop blaming thinking god punishing needing mom much move home adult mental health shes going taken didnt appreciate enough therapist says need accept possibility people get sick die like dont understand dont rationalize tells cant control moms health course life know god know heart broken control fix idea losing watching get ill makes want curl ball disappear im dying inside feel like cant breathe think like normally ocd anxiety stuff health stuff really irrational even happened id okay ive good erp doctor throwing leukemia results mom crying devastated suppose cope reality accept reality could lose suppose survive shes best friend biggest comfort greatest joy incredible mom world dad isnt really good person brother used close fiance doesnt like much feel like one turn like life shatter never recover dies im mad therapist like accept bad things happen know love god know doesnt mean absolutely devastating shouldnt sit accept dont know know results really bad someone studying medicine enough knowledge diagnosis feel like im waiting shoe drop diagnosis waiting lose,23,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jg95pp/my_mom_may_have_cancer/,Neutral,Moderate Concern

I was already on an ADHD medication (for 20 years) on top of that and Prozac (Before Xanax) making this situation real unsettling. On top of that, I vape. Now, my body's shaking, my chest feels like its slightly burning, and I'm afraid. The new doctor just cut me off from Xanax without any further explanation than me already having a controlled substance prescribed (35mg Dexmethylphenidate). I have not seen the doctors faces and I was already in blindly trusting it over visiting the counselor a few times. I think the Clinic has stopped the visits after I found a job. The 2 phycologists, I never met face to face, only over the phone. This is I suppose day 4 after the last Xanax, of my withdrawal and I am lost.

Also, reading that most of you had went through similar situations shows that I'm not alone in this. Sorry that y'all went through those experiences but glad for your recovery, even in process.

1jjhnyk,2025-03-25T17:30:31,The idea of Pregnancy scares me to death," 
Basically what the title says, although there is currently no risk of it happening the thought of me (20M) impregnating someone terrifies me. In my life I've hooked up with four Women but never properly had sex so there's no chance of that happening right now I am still somewhat scared to have sex with a Girl because of what I've just said and if worst comes to worst that hell might extend to her wanting to keep the Child. 

Often when I open Facebook and other social media platforms it seems as if someone else my age or who I went to school with is either pregnant or going to be a Father and though I'm so glad it's not me burdened with a Child I sometimes worry that one day I will get unlucky. I'm honestly so young and there's so much I want to do with my life, I'm not sure if I ever want Children but certainly not now. 

This may seem irrational as I couldn't possibly have impregnated anyone so I don't have anything to worry about, I put it down to the fact I have Autism and often suffer from anxiety from it but seriously though the thought of this is pretty bad. I reckon if I think about it too much longer the anxiety is gonna give me diarrhoea.

I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, even as a young child. I have some memories of when I was 2 years old, where I was EXTRA cautious about jumping around, running around, etc. I was constantly afraid of hurting myself for NO good reason.

  
Throughout my childhood, I had typical social anxiety that eventually got worse. I would cry as I gave presentations in class. I would physically shake if I had to talk to any adults (other than family). I got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. I tried a few different meds, but got bad about remembering to take them.

  
Fast forward to today. I have CONSTANT anxiety. If I have ONE bad experience, I believe that experience will happen every time and I'll try to avoid getting myself into those situations again. I am paranoid about everything. I have tornado and storm phobia and live in the midwest, so I am CONSTANTLY having anxiety attacks about storms. I'm terrified of going out in public for fear of kidnapping or getting hurt (even though I'm in a safe area). I've seen too many things online; and I have made myself stay off the internet for fear it was ruining my view of the world, but I've already seen things and know how messed up it can be and my view of the world has already been ruined. I was playing a video game with my boyfriend where you can roleplay with other players and I was driving a semi truck and hit someone's expensive car on accident. They called me a horrible name and I just started SOBBING. I felt horrible, even though it was a game. I'm now afraid to ever drive again for fear I'll hit someone's car IRL because if I can't handle being insulted and confronted by a real player in a video game, how can I handle it in real life?? I had two traumatic experiences with my knees and while they're okay now, I have anxiety over walking for fear I'm going to hurt myself again. I cannot even WALK without freaking out!



I barely go out with my boyfriend other than for dates because I'm terrified of people and their intentions. My anxiety LITERALLY controls my life and it is just getting worse. I feel like I should've never been born as a human because I cannot mentally or physically handle this anxiety. It's bad enough I have some sort of heart issues (my heartrate rests higher than normal people) and I have pre-hypertension with my blood pressure, so I feel like every anxiety attack (which I can have several a day, though usually only ONCE a day) is getting me closer to a heart attack or some other cardiac event.

I’ve been having panic attacks about dying, what will happen to me when I die, and every freaking sickness I read about online I then fall into a downward spiral thinking that’s going to happen to me. Right now I can’t stop panicking that I’m going to go blind, and now I keep having pains behind my eyes. My boyfriend is so sick of me I think he’s going to break up with me. He is getting to a point where he’s starting to freak out on me every time I try to talk to him about something. I can’t keep asking him for reassurance he is so sick of it. I have no one to talk to because no one understands. My whole family laughs at me and tells me I’m ridiculous whenever I bring up any concerns. They always tell me to stop worrying about everything I read online but it’s literally impossible. I do not know how to stop thinking every bad thing is going to happen to me. It’s waking me up at night. Does anyone have ANY advice that can hold me over until my therapy appointment in May I can’t keep living life like this.

Also- I read about the discord server for anxiety, has anyone used that? I’m considering trying it out so maybe I can find a friend who understands i literally have no friends besides my boyfriend. I also have terrible social anxiety so if I don’t respond to comments I’m not trying to be rude, I just get anxious and don’t know what to say 😕",anxiety,ive anxious whole life ive always suffered anxiety worrying everything feel like gotten significantly worse boyfriend also keeps telling worse lately ive panic attack almost every single day ive panic attacks dying happen die every freaking sickness read online fall downward spiral thinking thats going happen right cant stop panicking im going go blind keep pains behind eyes boyfriend sick think hes going break getting point hes starting freak every time try talk something cant keep asking reassurance sick one talk one understands whole family laughs tells im ridiculous whenever bring concerns always tell stop worrying everything read online literally impossible know stop thinking every bad thing going happen waking night anyone advice hold therapy appointment may cant keep living life like also read discord server anxiety anyone used im considering trying maybe find friend understands literally friends besides boyfriend also terrible social anxiety dont respond comments im trying rude get anxious dont know say,12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jidao6/im_looking_for_friendly_advice_please_anxiety_is/,Very Negative,Moderate Concern

They will find out that I never brushed and took care of my teeth, did nothing in all those years without seeing a dentist. I'm only now seeking a dentist because of an abcess/infection of a tooth that broke off YEARS ago, which could kill me now. Not only that, I have 1 more definite cavity, worn yellow teeth, small dark spots, 2 emerging wisdom teeth and so many issues in my mouth. Already imagining them listing all the issues I have makes me feel ashamed...And what if they ask me so many questions of why I didn't go sooner, what if they judge or scold me and stuff.   
I'm also scared to get my tooth pulled or that I'd need to go to the hospital in case the infection spread too deep into my bones,   
Plus the social anxiety... I really do not anticipate tomorrow :(

1jkgv1q,2025-03-26T22:37:12,My anxiety was more nutrition deficiency and poor diet than anxiety,"I want to share my story (32 F) so others can benefit in case they are in the same situation I was. I had daily panic attacks that turned into agoraphobia in 2019 for a few years. I was fearful of having panic symptoms in enclosed spaces, at shops, restaurants, driving, essentially everywhere and because 2020 hit, it all got worse. Anyway, long story short, in 2022 I found out I was quite low in ferritin iron (24) and started taking 200mg elemental iron twice per day with 1000mg vitamic c each time (get your blood tested first to make sure you are indeed low in vitamins/minerals first before supplementing), magnesium and vitamind D also helped with supplementing. I got my ferritin iron from 24 up to 130 within 4 months of that regiment and my panic attacks started intensely diminishing. Now, 3 years later, I still experience some anxious feelings but it went from fear levels of 110 to like a 10 in how much fear and symptoms of anxiety I feel. Another change I made was from a higher carb diet (white rice, bread, pasta) to eating more protein (eggs, meat, fish, nuts) and fiber (fruits and vegs and legumes like beans) and this also helped eliminate my anxiety a lot. One thing I've researched is that insulin resistance or sugar crashes also mimic anxiety feelings and cortisol/adrenaline surges, so if you can get your blood sugar to a better place, your anxiety symptoms will improve a lot too. I hope this helps others. I recommend speaking to a doctor first before supplementing, although they may tell you ferritin iron in the 20-50 range is good, optimal is still much higher than that, around 130 for six months, especially for menstruating women. Take care everyone and I hope things can improve for you like they did for me.

  
1. Get nutrients, vitamins, mineral levels checked through a blood test (iron, vitamin D, vitamin B's, etc). Start supplementing if you are low. 

2. Eat more protein and fiber and less processed carbohydrates. 

These two steps together made my anxiety go from 110 to 10.

The last thing I watched was Teen Wolf and since then I've always turned something else on but after 10 minutes at the latest I was looking for something new.

I don't like series like Friends or himym and I don't do well with horror or graphic violence. It depends how much, but Game of Thrones, for example, I had to stop after 30 minutes.

When I find something I watch it again and again, but at the moment the things I've watched before only bring back memories.

Can you recommend something? What are you doing to distract yourself? What is your comfort TV show? Or YouTube, Music, Documentaries, anything?😅

1jgixg3,2025-03-21T20:34:22,Anybody else here got subconsious anxiety?,"For some reason my anxiety rarely appears as conscious thoughts. I almost never actually think anxious thoughts, and most often my anxiety is just a vague, albeit potentially overwhelming feeling. 

Even worse, I often get just the physical symptoms of anxiety without feeling anxious at all. It's the most bizzare thing ever. I am not thinking about anything stressful or worrying while my throat feels like it's closing up and my lungs feel like I can't breathe. My conscious mind is completely calm but my body is in full fight or flight mode. 

I think it might be caused by some sort of instinctual emotional suppression, which is something I'm embarrasingly good at, as my default response to negative emotions is most often to squash them down, maybe dissociate and let them pass. This is why I get so freaked out when I get that ""wave of anxiety"" feeling when you feel like the whole world is closing in on you.

1jjstqj,2025-03-26T01:34:07,Anxiety from change,"
Does anyone else get crippling anxiety from changes? 

Here’s my story. In 2022 my boyfriend and I were planning a move to a new state so that he could attend school. I lived and have always lived in my little home town and have also never lived with a significant other.. while my boyfriend and I were living together at the time, it was with his parents - so it’s different. About 2 months prior to the move, we visited some family in another state and attended a wine tasting as a going away gift for my boyfriend. That night was the first night I had ever experienced anxiety. When I went to bed, I started to get a stomach ache and had to use the restroom.. now normally, wine and beer doesn’t sit well with my stomach so I wasn’t too shocked that this was happening. But then I started to panic, I felt a burning sensation throughout my whole body, I couldn’t stop twitching, and didn’t feel real. It was the most bizarre feeling. I eventually fell asleep and the next day was better. However, slowly and slowly it started showing itself at certain times. The second time I got it was 2 months later when we went on a camping trip (this was about a week before we were planning to drive a Uhaul to our new place in a new state and move all of our stuff in). During our camping trip I was totally fine, up until I realized that I wasn’t experiencing the anxiety (side bar: I didn’t know it was anxiety yet, I thought maybe it was wine, or sugar, or caffeine). The second I checked in with myself to see how I was feeling, I got the stomach ache and out of body feeling and had to go to bed immediately. 

I started to think that this was all happening because I was making a big move and that it’ll all stop when I get settled into our new home in our new state, but it hasn’t gone away. I only ever get the anxiety if I am traveling or if people are visiting. I will get small sensations of it when I do new things, like go to concerts, meet new people, or anything outside of my normal routine.. but that usually stops after I do whatever the event or occasion is and it won’t happen the next time. It however has not gone away for when I travel or have people visit me. 

I’m not afraid of flying, I’m afraid of getting anxiety and being stuck on a plane. I am also not afraid of people, I am afraid of getting anxiety and being stuck somewhere that I can’t calm down. 

About a year ago my boyfriend and I got a cat and I was so anxious when he came home. I wanted to get rid of him for the first week, but I eventually got used to it and now I love him so much. 

My boyfriend proposed to me in November of 2024 and I felt slightly anxious after that and shamefully wanted to go back in time and not deal with the engagement, because I hated the anxiety. That eventually subsided and now I’m so happy.

After that I started avoiding wedding planning because I didn’t want to deal with the anxiety that comes with it. I noticed that I’m doing things to avoid getting anxiety, so I decided that I wanted to do a mini elopement. I decided that we would do a small wedding the same weekend that my fiancé was graduating since everyone would be in town already. So I put the plan in action and sent out invites to everyone (he is graduating in May of this year so it’d be 2 months away). To give an overview of where I was at a week ago, I was planning on trying for a baby, planning a wedding, and we had some changes coming up in the next two months with him graduating and us moving back home.. a lot of exciting things! But, the night I sent the invites out.. I was hit with the absolute worst anxiety of my life. I was down for 5 days, feeling absolutely horrible. I couldn’t get out of the fight of flight feeling and was an absolute wreck. It resulted in me canceling the wedding and deciding it was just too much for me to handle. I also had put a hold on trying for baby. 

I always thought that the anxiety was due to traveling and social events, but when I got the anxiety just from being at home, I started to think I was going insane and my mind was giving up on me. However now, I’m realizing it’s due to life changes or pretty much doing anything outside of my ordinary routine. 

Does this happen to anyone else? I am feeling better knowing that there may be a root cause to all of this, but I also feel so alone in my thoughts. I’ve started to feel like my life is over.. I feel like I can never have kids because I’m scared of getting anxiety and not being able to change my mind once I have them (depressing and morbid, I know). I feel like I won’t be able to have the wedding I want because I’m scared of the anxiety. I have all of these fears and feel lost. I’m really just looking for people who can relate to my story. Does it ever get better?

Worrying about how youre affecting others and wanting that reassurance that you’re doing okay and that everything will be okay even when you’re in the wrong.

But what’s messed up is that sometimes when anxiety is caused by the reassurance need not being met as a child, it manifests as you seeking that reassurance constantly later. So regardless of if you needed that reassurance and never got it so you had to quickly learn how to get it from people or give it to yourself, if you needed that reassurance later in life, you’re just going to end up having to meet your own need again.

1jjzroe,2025-03-26T06:33:24,I’ve been crying myself to sleep every night for months,"Ten months ago, I had a strange viral illness. I had a fever, severe nausea, and painful wrists and ankles for about ten days. My ANA came back borderline at the time, but later turned negative. Ever since, I’ve been spiraling. I constantly read online about autoimmune diseases, especially lupus, and I’m terrified.
After that  I lost my appetite, developed IBS-like symptoms, my blood pressure and heart rate started spiking, and I began getting hives and panic attacks symptoms . I kept going to the ER thinking I was dying. I’ve had countless tests – autoimmune panels, MRI, endoscopy, ultrasound, CT scans – and everything has come back normal. My liver enzymes were slightly elevated at times, so I insisted on a liver biopsy, which thankfully came back negative.

Doctors kept telling me it was anxiety. But I couldn’t stop obsessing. I spent every waking hour reading online about lupus. Eventually, my symptoms worsened again – I developed frequent urination, more hives, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, especially at midnight. I had multiple ER visits with heart rates hitting 150 bpm and  shortness of breath

I saw two rheumatologists – all tests came back negative. My echocardiogram, chest CT, and spirometry were normal. A urologist did a cystoscopy and diagnosed me with IC (interstitial cystitis). Still,my symptoms come in monthly flares: I get sick, see doctors, everything is normal, I feel okay for a while, then it starts again.

Recently, I went to the ER for mild nausea. My urine showed trace protein and microscopic blood, but my ultrasound and infection markers were normal. I have no UTI, yet I panicked – convinced lupus is silently attacking my kidneys. I redid my autoimmune labs – all negative again – but urine still shows trace protein and blood. I cry constantly. I can’t function. My C4 is 14 (normal range 10-40 but on the lower end), and I’m scared it’s creeping toward lupus nephritis.

I saw a Reddit post from a girl who had abnormal urine for two years and mild knee swelling, with negative autoimmune tests. Then, two years later, she was diagnosed with lupus and tests turned positive . Her story destroyed me. I have a little daughter and I’m terrified of dying, of leaving her alone. I haven’t felt joy in 10 months. I’ve spent so much money on doctors and tests. Nothing helps.

I started psychiatric meds two weeks ago, but they haven’t helped much yet. Therapy sessions barely work – I feel better for a couple of hours, then crash again.

I don’t have clear autoimmune symptoms. Just constant stress, hives, elevated IgE, and deep fear. What if this is early lupus? What if it’s hurting my kidneys silently? I feel trapped in this never-ending cycle of fear.
honestly don’t know if what I’m experiencing is a real illness or just the result of anxiety and overthinking. I keep seeing people on TikTok who were eventually diagnosed with lupus or scleroderma, and they all say that for years, doctors told them it was just in their head or caused by anxiety.

1jk8m8s,2025-03-26T15:59:40,I overcame my biggest anxiety I’ve had in my life today. I passed my driving test!,"I just needed to share this somewhere. I (32F) just passed my driving test! I have been putting it off due to anxiety for years and I have just overcome it on my first try! I am someone who can’t handle the pressure of a test, but today I managed to not let it get to me and I passed! I’m insanely proud of myself for finally doing it. I’ve been beating myself up for years every time I let my anxiety take over. 

I heard it all the time, “everyone is anxious when they first start driving”. While that may be true, it’s not really helpful to someone who struggles with bad anxiety. I’ve done bouts of driving lessons and driving around but I have always let my anxiety stop me from going any further. The one time I felt like I was getting closer to being able to do my test was interrupted when I was hit by a car as a pedestrian. With the setback of not being able to drive due to brain injury and my anxiety level spiking, I gave up again. 

The longer I left it the more ashamed I was. The occasional comment that judged my lack of driving made me feel like everyone was judging me. I’m glad I’ll never have to hear “when are you going to get your license?” again. 

I still have driving anxiety, but I am so proud that I got over my test anxiety. The test itself actually felt pretty calm and I ended up having a near perfect drive.

1jjsov9,2025-03-26T01:28:49,I just wanna feel normal again :(,"Hello everybody, before I share anything else, I should mention some context of my anxiety. I had my first ever anxiety attack last summer, and that was under the influence of cannabis (first experience). After sleeping it off, I was just fine. 

Fast forward 6-7 months (right after new years), I had another attack, this time I was sober, and had only one thing that may have caused it. I have been on and off with my ex, and at the time of the attack, it was the 1 month mark of us having no contact, and earlier on in the day I was extremely sad about it. However, during the time of the attack, I wasn’t thinking about her or thinking about anything at all. I know that stressful thoughts can build up subconsciously in the back of your mind, but ever since this first attack, I haven’t been normal, and I really just want to feel like myself again. 

It’s been around 4 months since my first attack, and I honestly haven’t had an anxiety/panic attack in over a month now, but my body seems to react to it differently. Instead of being okay for a certain amount of time, and then occasionally have anxiety attacks (like the majority of people do), I DONT really have anxiety attacks, as I’m able to control them before they get to me too bad. Although I don’t really have anxiety attacks anymore, my everyday life is affected, from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I seem to constantly be in a fight/flight mode where I think I’m going to die, when I literally have myself convinced that I’m okay. 

Throughout the day, I have a variety of different feelings that completely change how I act. Recently, I’ve had the same vision feeling where my eyes can’t seem to relax, along with my mind constantly running. I don’t really know how to explain it, but this feeling is one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced, and on top of that, it’s affecting my sleep schedule, as it takes hours to even fall asleep. 

I should mention that I have tried therapy. Unfortunately, it made things worse for me because when I focus on my anxiety (such as talking about it), I can’t stop thinking about it, which leads to that fight/flight mode, vision feeling, etc. Also, I feel like nothing is real, “dissociation” is what people call it I believe. Additionally, I’ve been on multiple different medications, such as Xanax, buspar, hydroxyzine, and another one I don’t remember the name of. Currently I’m on bupropion, it’s been around 3 1/2-4 weeks and I notice no significant changes in my anxiety. If anybody can help me feel like I’m not alone, or try suggesting some things, please do.

1jgpevp,2025-03-22T01:05:13,Had to Cancel Seeing Husband Overseas,"Long story short, my husband has been overseas for about 6 months. I had plans to go see him this morning. Well, my anxiety got in the way, MAJORLY. Last night I could not sleep, which eventually kept me up for about 24-27ish hours. I dozed off a couple times, likely sleeping a total of about 2 hours. 

(This may sound silly, but last summer we went to Europe for the first time and I think I got traumatized by my first major time change, I’m a bit of a hypochondriac, so not getting enough sleep has started to scare me.)


My mom picks me up, takes me to the airport, but I can’t get out. She tries to encourage me, my husband calls for encouragement (blessed, he doesn’t get upset with me or mad), I try to encourage myself. But the idea that I had already been up for 24 hours + had a 15 hour flight alone..my thoughts were racing. 

All night I had been having other physical symptoms of anxiety/panic and they hadn’t really stopped. I ended up not boarding my flight. 


I’m SO disappointed. Not in the fact that I didn’t go, but in the fact that I think the way I think and that it gets in the way of so many things. I do not think I would’ve had a good flight or day once I landed because of the anxiety and sleep and time change added on with such the long flight. I just am not sure I’m in the right headspace for that right now. 

There is a possibility of me flying in next week with my in laws, but even so, I’m not sure I feel comfortable. 


I’m doing an extra therapy session this coming week to get my therapist’s opinion. I also had children’s melatonin that I think I should try out sometime this week, but also have a fear of trying new meds.😅

1jht4w7,2025-03-23T12:04:52,Anxiety at night,"I need help. I’m a 20-year veteran with 4 deployments. During my first deployment, I suffered an injury on the left side of my face that required 2 surgeries (septoplasty and turbinoplasty) to repair a deviated septum and remove scar and bone/calcium built up after the injury. 

Before the surgery, it felt like I couldn’t breathe out of my left side nose trail and affected my running and other physical activities until the surgery. 25 years have passed since then, but now I am starting to have some issues again.

A few months ago, I began to suddenly wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety, feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I ran outside the house feeling like I was drowning. It was wintertime, so the cold somehow helped, and little by little, with the help of my wife, I began to calm down. It had never happened before until now. Since then, I spoke to my PCM at the VA and got a referral for ENT. My psych prescribed a few Xanax for the anxiety for when it hits the worst. The ENT says there is not a deviated septum (which was my first though) not scar tissue built up over time (like before) but since the first time it happened, I started trying every single thing I can find to try to help it… from trying every single nose device that flares the nose to break better at night (have found a few that work, but my inside of the nose is now raw from the in/out and the mucus irritating it from the foreign device that was never before there), the Airwav mouth guard, trying Afrin and phenols prone sprays (kids dose only at night before bed), but it seems that  ow has become a crutch and I can’t sleep without all of these things… the thought of having to do this every night gives me even more anxiety. 

I remember the surgery I had. They put those plastic blades in the sinus cavity, and I remember I couldn’t breathe but through my mouth then. And the thought of it gives me anxiety. I don’t think I can make it through weeks of having those things in my nose for weeks until it heals, swelling goes down, and pain subsides… never mind that I can’t take pain meds because of prior issues with narcotics due to multiple surgeries over a 3-year period that kept me on pain management long-term that did their own damage… now it’s all me, nothing but Tylenol, and as I type this with my wife lying in bed next to me at 1:24AM not able to sleep because of this crippling anxiety that makes me have to take a half Xanax just to hope to be able to sleep while listening to anxiety-reducing meditations on YouTube… 

I am at a loss, and my mind wonders where it shouldn’t after thinking about it, having to deal with this long-term and worse, putting my wife through this… it affects everything from sleep, turns what could be a good day into a bad one, and I am tired of it… I just wanted to put this out there to see if someone else experiences this, knows what “this” is, does it have a name? A cure? What have you done to try to fix it that has worked?… I need to figure out how to control it before it takes over… any help is greatly appreciated.",anxiety,need help im year veteran deployments first deployment suffered injury left side face required surgeries septoplasty turbinoplasty repair deviated septum remove scar bonecalcium built injury surgery felt like couldnt breathe left side nose trail affected running physical activities surgery years passed since starting issues months ago began suddenly wake middle night extreme anxiety feeling like couldnt breathe ran outside house feeling like drowning wintertime cold somehow helped little little help wife began calm never happened since spoke pcm va got referral ent psych prescribed xanax anxiety hits worst ent says deviated septum first though scar tissue built time like since first time happened started trying every single thing find try help trying every single nose device flares nose break better night found work inside nose raw inout mucus irritating foreign device never airwav mouth guard trying afrin phenols prone sprays kids dose night bed seems ow become crutch cant sleep without things thought every night gives even anxiety remember surgery put plastic blades sinus cavity remember couldnt breathe mouth thought gives anxiety dont think make weeks things nose weeks heals swelling goes pain subsides never mind cant take pain meds prior issues narcotics due multiple surgeries year period kept pain management longterm damage nothing tylenol type wife lying bed next able sleep crippling anxiety makes take half xanax hope able sleep listening anxietyreducing meditations youtube loss mind wonders shouldnt thinking deal longterm worse putting wife affects everything sleep turns could good day bad one tired wanted put see someone else experiences knows name cure done try fix worked need figure control takes help greatly appreciated,7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jht4w7/anxiety_at_night/,Neutral,Moderate Concern

1jir9ii,2025-03-24T19:27:26,Neck/shoulder stiffness and trembling,"I have been struggling with this physical symptom of anxiety and for the most part have been managing okay on my own with healthy diet, sleep schedule, exercise, and meditation. I’ve also been taking a magnesium+ashwaganda supplement, lemon balm, and CBD when I have it. Regular hot baths and calming teas, and even tried taking kratom and microdosing with psychedelics. Basically my every day revolves around implementing an arsenal of coping strategies for keeping the anxiety at bay while trying to live a normal life. I have my good days, but on my bad days I can’t control the physical symptoms and it’s starting to feel almost debilitating. My neck, shoulders, and back will stiffen to the point that I’ll start noticeably trembling. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I’ve been zapped with electricity and I’m paralyzed in this extremely tense state. It’s embarrassing for me when it happens in front of other people, which only contributes to the stress in the moment and makes the trembling worse. I can be triggered by some of the most mundane, basic, everyday occurrences and it’s very frustrating. I know that I need therapy to address the underlying “why” this is happening, but I’m wondering if anybody else has dealt with the physical symptoms I’ve described and if there is any medication that could help specifically with the neck stiffness and trembling. I’ve never been treated for anxiety, I’ve long accepted it as something I just have to live with but this trembling problem is really affecting my quality of life at this point and I’m willing to try anything to get this under control.

1jibwap,2025-03-24T04:10:26,IT GETS BETTER.,"Hey everyone. I remember when I was struggling a few months ago all I wanted to be certain of was, would it ever get better? 

Guess what, it does. 

In August 2024 I started to struggle super fucking bad, and I mean, super bad. One bad panic attack sent me into months of horrible anxiety. I couldnt eat, I couldnt sleep, I hated being alone with myself and my thoughs, I hate even thinking back on that time in my life.

I stayed curled up on the couch all day and glued to the tv/or games on my phone to avoid it all. I left my job, my life was falling apart... it affected every waking second of my life.

I started lexapro. The side effects were terrible. Ended up in the hospital because I became suicidal. Hospital didnt care and gave me more pills. I got into a deeper pit of depression and despair. 

In October things became unbearable. I couldnt function. I woke up one day and started screaming and crying, with a pain I had never experienced before. I knew then I really wanted to die. 

I went to church that day, my last resort, and begged God to help me. I was crying in a quiet church like a crazy person... i held onto the smallest bit of hope I had left... 

On my 24th birthday in November I decided enough was enough, I couldnt do this anymore and had to make a change. I was too scared to kill myself (thank God) so I decided to better myself. 

I deleted reddit. I would spend hours researching on this subreddit and ones like it, and it only made me worse... I was convincing myself I had brain cancer & everything. 

I couldnt afford therapy or counselling so...

I researched. I watched hours of videos on youtube on how to treat anxiety. How to treat panic attacks. How to treat depersonalisation. How to treat agoraphobia. I listened to personal testimonies. I meditated. I did breathwork, this was amazing for me. I did somatic tracking and healing. Tapping. I touched grass lol. I journalled. I had panic attacks and sat with myself during them. I slowly started to leave the house again. I listened to my intrusive thoughts and spoke back to them. I spoke out loud to myself all day long and reassured myself. 

Brain retraining, look into it if youre suffering with intrusive thoughts especially. Look into neuro plasticity. 

Please, take it from me, if youre struggling right now, it does get better. 
I couldnt even sit down and watch a movie in the comfort of my own without having a panic attack.

I can sleep again. I havent had a panic attack since late November. I havent wanted to take my own life since November. I can go out in public again, I can smile again, I feel like I can live again. 

I still have anxiety everyday, low levels, but some days I can just laugh it off with the tools Ive learnt. 

I deleted reddit. I redownloaded it yesterday and saw all my old posts and comments. I want to tell that person everything is going to work out. 

I dont take any medication right now and have no desire to (because Im in a way better place). But if you need it and/or want to try it out please dont hesitate: this message is just hope that if they havent worked out for you, you can still get better. 

Im open to any questions. I cant believe I finally get to be this person I was hoping to be months ago that can actually help.

1jjysaz,2025-03-26T05:46:36,My Body Physically Shuts Down Around My Wife and Child,"This has been happening for about three years now.

I started to get really bad exhaustion around the time my son was born, which you know, makes sense.... as time went on, I found that no matter what I did, it never went away. No matter how much sleep I got, no matter what I ate, how much I exercised. I had blood tests, an overnight stay in a sleep clinic, I tried everything, but there seemed to be no real physical reason why I was always so exhausted.

I mean, my body would always completely shut down, like I would wake up at 6am after 8 hours of deep sleep, but by 8am I was ready to go down again.

Time went on and it hasn't gotten better, but I've learned to cope with it, I do my workout first thing in the morning and live on caffeine, and I get by. Last year I was diagnosed with clinic depression and it kind of made sense to link it all together.

I started seeing a psychiatrist and got on some medication, and things have been a bit better, my moods been better, I've been more motivated, but the exhaustion? Still there.

I've noticed things though...

I don't really get this feeling at work. In fact, I love being at work. I feel in control, appreciated, I have more energy. I enjoy my lunch break, as 'me time'.

But the weekends? F\*\*k me... they drag at a snail's pace as my three-year old challenges every single request I have and my wife get's emotional about the smallest of things. It's stressful, it makes me ANXIOUS.

I brought this up to my psychiatrist yesterday and he thought it made sense, that my body was having a physical anxiety reaction to my complex feelings around my loved ones, feelings of love, guilt, frustration, shame. Feelings I don't know how to handle or interpret, so... my body shuts down, physically, it just goes 'Nope' and f\*\*king goes to sleep... I can feel my eyelids flutter, everything weighs a thousand pounds and I feel myself drop.

The ironic thing?

I get in the car to go home yesterday evening, and my wife asked how my appointment was. I tell her about this theory, about how I discussed with my psychiatrist that I might be getting anxious feelings from the stress of my oppositional three-year old and from her, and she immediately starts to get all teary eyes and turn this issue into a blame game.

Right on cue, my eyelids drop, my body feels heavy, I am ready to sleep for a thousand years - incredible.

I get it's difficult for her to hear, but here's the thing - I am trying to better myself, she isn't.

Anyway, does anyone else understand or get this? Do specific people in your lives cause you to shut down depending on your relationship with them? For some added context, I've noticed that when my son is generally being agreeable (for a three-year old) I feel a bit more energetic, and when things are good with my wife, I don't feel the need to take a nap during the day, etc.

Does anyone else share in these feelings or experiences?",anxiety,happening three years started get really bad exhaustion around time son born know makes sense time went found matter never went away matter much sleep got matter ate much exercised blood tests overnight stay sleep clinic tried everything seemed real physical reason always exhausted mean body would always completely shut like would wake hours deep sleep ready go time went hasnt gotten better ive learned cope workout first thing morning live caffeine get last year diagnosed clinic depression kind made sense link together started seeing psychiatrist got medication things bit better moods better ive motivated exhaustion still ive noticed things though dont really get feeling work fact love work feel control appreciated energy enjoy lunch break time weekends fk drag snails pace threeyear old challenges every single request wife gets emotional smallest things stressful makes anxious brought psychiatrist yesterday thought made sense body physical anxiety reaction complex feelings around loved ones feelings love guilt frustration shame feelings dont know handle interpret body shuts physically goes nope fking goes sleep feel eyelids flutter everything weighs thousand pounds feel drop ironic thing get car go home yesterday evening wife asked appointment tell theory discussed psychiatrist might getting anxious feelings stress oppositional threeyear old immediately starts get teary eyes turn issue blame game right cue eyelids drop body feels heavy ready sleep thousand years incredible get difficult hear heres thing trying better isnt anyway anyone else understand get specific people lives cause shut depending relationship added context ive noticed son generally agreeable threeyear old feel bit energetic things good wife dont feel need take nap day etc anyone else share feelings experiences,5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jjysaz/my_body_physically_shuts_down_around_my_wife_and/,Positive,Moderate Concern

I realized if I wanted to change, I had to reprogram how I thought and how I lived.

•Fitness – Boxing, resistance training, and movement changed my energy

•Mindfulness & journaling – Rewiring my self-talk and patterns

•Spiritual growth – Dispenza, NA, Māori wisdom—all tools to reconnect

•Service – Giving back gave me direction again

1jjzyk3,2025-03-26T06:42:50,I want to quit practicing addiction medicine!,"I've been practicing addiction medicine in some form for almost 26 years. Never in my career have I felt more defeated or wanted to quit as much as I do right now.

I have a patient I've known since she was 17. Over the years, she became more than just a patient to me; she felt like one of my daughters. Even after she moved out of state, we kept in touch regularly. Her mother and I tried everything we could think of to help her become sober and to keep her alive.

In my career, I've only worked with patients who've already chosen to become sober. That's who walks into my office. She originally came to me with her mother for help at 17. Every doctor said she was addicted to opioids, but no one wanted to help because of her age. For them, it was incredibly challenging, frustrating, and heartbreaking. But I gladly took her in. At the time, I had a concierge addiction practice which meant I had all the time in the world to spend with each patient. I helped her become sober from opioids. I remembered that the text messages between her, her mother, and I numbered in the thousands. She stopped the opioids but the cocaine and benzodiazepines continued. I sent her to counseling, psychiatry for her mental health, but she just wouldn't stop. I wouldn't fire her because I feared she would ultimately relapse and die from an opioid overdose.

She eventually moved out of state but we kept in touch. Recently, she went into an inpatient facility and became sober from everything. However, she was not taking methadone or buprenorphine. So, I feared she would eventually have a lapse and return to opioids or another drug. PAWS is a real thing and most clinics don't warn patients. She maintained 8 weeks of sobriety and her mind was starting to clear up. She started to realized how F up her life was. She started speaking like a mature adult and had goals. Everything started getting better. Wow was the thought on my mind every time we talked. But I was so afraid of that lapse.

Saturday, her mother sent me a text. She died from an overdose. The police believe it was from opioids based upon what they found. It’s seriously haunting me.

All of my appointments are audio recorded. I've been listening to them as I drive. Our conversations were like those I have with my own daughters. I find myself wishing that I'd spoken with her more, reached out more often, or said something different. But to be honest with myself, I can't imagine what I could have said to make things any different!! I am so angry right now. But I don't know what else I could have done. I don't know what I am going to say or do when I see the parents. They have to go without their 25 year old daughter. I still have mine. Life is so unfair and I can't continue to see young people die like this. As much as I want to quit, I know I have so many people depending on me right now to help them with their journey.

1jjwefy,2025-03-26T04:01:09,"losing my virginity to a hooker led to me spending majority of my life savings, cant even stop either","long story short, im 21 years old, and have spent the last 6 years of my life completely alone for the most part, i have no social life, i was the lonely loser in highschool that would hide in the bathrooms to kill time. i didnt ever get female attention, really i would avoid them for the most part out of insecurity. i still live with my family, but being the oldest out of my siblings i really felt eager to get financially free asap, i started putting most my life savings in the stockmarket as soon as i turned 18 and i stayed disciplined up until i was 20, i would do a lot of unnecessary stuff to save money, and it payed off i suppose, at my peak last year i had 50k saved up in stock equity (most i ever had)

to add more context i was always addicted to porn, i had discovered it and frequently watched it in my middleschool years of my life and it went on until i was 20, then it started to get more severe, onlyfans starts spreading, its all that pops up on my feed now, so i give in, in total i probably spent like 4k-6k on OF i would rather not check but thats my closest guess. 

eventually my 50k networth at 20 gets closer to like 35k at the end of last year, because i also did help my family with their credit card debt and my part of the bills for the year

its now a week before valentines day in 2025 and im super sad one day for whatever reason i get the bright idea of finally losing my virginity to a hooker, i was already in the area, the first time i got scammed, the second time i finally lost my virginity! i felt a boost in ego, and wanted more immediately, in total my first week after finding where to go, i had already spent 2grand , i would tell myself stuff like, i wont let my account go lower than 30k, then it gets that low, now im saying 25k is my limit, it got so bad my 35k at the start of this year is now  only 12k as of today :(

[all that i have left now](https://preview.redd.it/b8xszqw6vwqe1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21b0930192f4142067dff7ccfb116756b4a4e7d7)

i think the first 3 weeks of doing this it was the excitement of sex that kept me going but then i started to gain attachment with just one regular hooker, and i would say thats what really started to get me to spend irrational amounts certain nights, sometimes i wish i never met her, but sometimes i hate to see her go, so i pay extra to stay with her longer, my porn addiction essentially translated to a sex addiction i would always go crazy amounts of rounds for no reason, it didnt hit me that wasnt normal until one day she, a hooker, called me a sex addict that kinda made me think after that day.

 i still regularly go to her and like i said its not even about the sex at this point i enjoy her presence we usually hang out in between rounds just talking while we smoke or get something to eat, i still get anxious around her but just the ease of having someone engaged enough to make me feel noticed feels good, really good, i cant let it go, and i dont even want to try and replicate it with anyone else i know its unhealthy and im just stuck in a money pit by paying for sex and company but ive just lost all motivation in life i guess

1jk4xfx,2025-03-26T11:20:57,My Life Is In Ruins,"Let me just start off by saying that my now ex girlfriend/baby mama (31F), and I (34M) are cocaine addicts. It has completely destroyed our lives.

I've been using for about 4 years, and she has been using for about 12 years. The last 2 have been the worst of my life.

I started to lose control when my grandma's (the woman that raised me) health started to decline severely. When she died 2 years ago, I went into a grief spiral, and completely nuked everything.

The following is what I've been through in just the last year alone:

-5 pinks slips
-3 job firings
-2 break ups w/ my baby mama (yesterday was the second time)
-1 accidental cocaine overdose
-1 fetty lace overdose
-1 apartment eviction
-2 inpatient rehabs
-1 sober living (Got kicked out for relapsing)

I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I hate it. So much. It has taken nearly everything from me. In the last 24 hours, it has cost me my job, and my relationship.

She was everything to me. I fought so fucking hard for her. Harder than I've ever fought for anyone, including myself. She was my person. My soulmate.

The drugs changed us both. It stole our attention away from everything that mattered. We were best friends, partners, and lovers.

I have gotten better with my usage, but her's has gotten so much worse. It's taking her mental health to extremely dangerous places. We are both toxic individuals, and it's worse in our relationship. We both just keep triggering and enabling each other.

I hope that one day we will get sober and healthy, and we'll have a chance to try again. Staying together now will only hurt or kill each other.

I'm trying to focus on myself and my sons, but it's still fresh. If not being with me saves her life, then I will gladly sacrifice what I want. This is hard. She was the love of my life. The only woman that ever made me feel seen, heard, and understood. She made me feel unconditionally loved.

I know I have to let her go to save us both, but I love her so fucking much. Things have to get better from here. This is my last chance to save myself.

I am very worried about her, I ignored all her messages/calls yesterday I just can't, my anger towards her does not allow me to talk to her.

I don't want to talk to her at all until she gets clean but I do want to tell her she needs to get help any advice on that would be greatly appreciated. Unsure if I should send a stern message or more of a heartfelt message I know she's at her lowest right now. Knowing her she is very deep into drugs so I know she will go back to him, I truly believe he will kill her.

I’m 22 years old and have been drinking alcohol regularly since I was 16. Today, I had a moment of realization that really shook me. It’s currently 1:51 PM, and I’ve already had 5 Desperados (330ml) – and this is before work. It doesn’t even scare me anymore; it just feels normal.

I also haven’t eaten anything for the past two days. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, but I’m starting to realize how much everything is spiraling out of control.

A bit disappointed, angry, sad

But not frustrated

I know I made the concious choice to relapse

Despite EVERYTHING in my life going well (which I worked hard for), I still relapsed.

But it's fine

Because I am not that person...I never was.  We make a big deal out of our addictions which makes it worse.

Life is tough, therefore there are battles I am going to face that may take 6 years to beat. I beat my addiction. 


I had a relapse. It does NOT change or takeaway my progress. I know exactly why I relapsed, I know the exact dominoes of thoughts and actions that I did to make the decidion to relapse.

That means I also know how to stop it and redirect the energy.

That's life, you fall. Just get back up, right your wrongs and be even more ferocious my brothers. 

It ain't the end of the world lol 

we win in the end

Losing is GUARANTEED in life. Seriously. The winners are continuing forward in spite of the losses.

Your choice is so simple - wallow in your loss or win?

1jid36j,2025-03-24T05:04:39,The last birthday gift I gave my brother were pain pills,"The last birthday gift I gave my brother came in a small white box. 

Nothing frilly, just a box I had laying around at home. I didn’t gift wrap it or add a colorful bow. I simply wrote “Happy Birthday Joe” on a note, and left it in my mailbox, where he would pick it up early that morning.

All that mattered was my surprise gift inside. A small baggie of pain pills.

I wasn’t sure exactly what kind they were. Leftovers from prescription medications for various ailments, injuries and procedures.

My brother consistently complained about being in pain, all over his 50-year-old body, for reasons I was never clear about. His body was breaking down from living a hard life.

He physically looked like he was in pain. It affected his gait, his attitude, his every activity, I’m guessing. I couldn’t think of a better gift to give him. He later thanked me profusely.

I doubt that those pills lasted very long. Maybe a couple of days. Maybe just his birthday. He had an incredibly high threshold for pain pills and other substances.

A dose that would knock me out for the night would make him comfortably numb, I’m guessing. A euphoria I’ve never experienced.

I thought of my brother when I suffered a recent backache, of unknown cause. I just woke up one morning and it was killing me. I couldn’t bend over. I couldn’t twist around. It hurt to get into my car.

My instinctive reaction was to search through my medicine cabinet for any pain pills. I didn’t care what kind I had. I didn’t care what milligram level they were. I didn’t care if they were brand name or generic. I simply wanted the pain to end. I popped a couple of pills. The next day, I popped a couple more. My back pain eventually faded.

But the feelings I experienced haven’t faded away. I still think of my big brother and his pain. And all those people who are in pain or who believe they’re in pain on a daily basis.

According to data from the Centers for Disease and Prevention Control, the No. 1 way that prescription drug users improperly acquire opioids is from a friend or relative. Guilty as charged, your honor. This is exactly what I did with my brother on his last birthday.

I have lived a relatively pain-free life, though I’m currently experiencing knee, shoulder and wrist pain that is causing me chronic problems. My fortunate past has spoiled me and it has altered my judgment toward others who live in chronic pain. I too often lack enough empathy or compassion for them. This is easy to do when you’re not in pain every hour of every day.

Yes, I’ve made some healthy decisions in my life. And yes, I’ve been very lucky for my age, 62. Anything could happen to my health at any time, causing me serious pain and serious consideration about using pain pills on a regular basis.

My family history with painkillers and addiction leaves me rarely surprised about our country’s addiction to pain pills.

Can you imagine taking a handful of Vicodin in one day? I can’t. But my brother probably could have imagined it, and he possibly could take that many at once. I don’t know. Maybe one of your loved ones or friends could, too.

I once met a drug court client who told me he had such a high tolerance to pills, such as Xanax, that he could take between 10 to 30 pills in a 48-hour period, depending on his supply. The most pills he ever took in one sitting was 17, he told me.

Again, I wasn’t surprised. That interview came just four months after my brother died of a heart attack, related to his long-term drug abuse. At that time, I intentionally wrote about this issue to help me better understand his addiction to pain pills. Obviously, I’m still trying to understand.

To this day, though, I have no regrets giving him that birthday gift.",addiction,last birthday gift gave brother came small white box nothing frilly box laying around home didnt gift wrap add colorful bow simply wrote happy birthday joe note left mailbox would pick early morning mattered surprise gift inside small baggie pain pills wasnt sure exactly kind leftovers prescription medications various ailments injuries procedures brother consistently complained pain yearold body reasons never clear body breaking living hard life physically looked like pain affected gait attitude every activity im guessing couldnt think better gift give later thanked profusely doubt pills lasted long maybe couple days maybe birthday incredibly high threshold pain pills substances dose would knock night would make comfortably numb im guessing euphoria ive never experienced thought brother suffered recent backache unknown cause woke one morning killing couldnt bend couldnt twist around hurt get car instinctive reaction search medicine cabinet pain pills didnt care kind didnt care milligram level didnt care brand name generic simply wanted pain end popped couple pills next day popped couple back pain eventually faded feelings experienced havent faded away still think big brother pain people pain believe theyre pain daily basis according data centers disease prevention control way prescription drug users improperly acquire opioids friend relative guilty charged honor exactly brother last birthday lived relatively painfree life though im currently experiencing knee shoulder wrist pain causing chronic problems fortunate past spoiled altered judgment toward others live chronic pain often lack enough empathy compassion easy youre pain every hour every day yes ive made healthy decisions life yes ive lucky age anything could happen health time causing serious pain serious consideration using pain pills regular basis family history painkillers addiction leaves rarely surprised countrys addiction pain pills imagine taking handful vicodin one day cant brother probably could imagined possibly could take many dont know maybe one loved ones friends could met drug court client told high tolerance pills xanax could take pills hour period depending supply pills ever took one sitting told wasnt surprised interview came four months brother died heart attack related longterm drug abuse time intentionally wrote issue help better understand addiction pain pills obviously im still trying understand day though regrets giving birthday gift,136,4,https://i.redd.it/8pq47iajyiqe1.jpeg,Neutral,Moderate Concern

Is so few are ever willing to share about their addiction WHILE they're in addiction. I can guess why ... But why not? I do. I'll say straight up it's meth, too. If that's the condition I'm in, that's the condition I'm in. Such is life ... 



Some of us find ourselves depressed some days, happy other days, in the hospital some others days, or flat on our face naked in the middle of the street some others. Maybe at that point we're dead. If that's the condition we're in ... That's the condition we're in. Again ... Such is life.


I don't expect everyone to think this deeply and keep perspective, but we are on a ball floating through a vast billions of years old universe. I don't know who decided I was shit for a human because I struggle with ADDICTION, but, as you could probably guess, maybe some people need a better understanding of what that is, if you feel so inclined, or want to paint them a picture so they'll have a better impression of you. Fact is our brains have found something it believes is worthy of using to cope. It doesn't see the consequences of using it ... That takes the thinking part of our brain to figure out, right? It just knows this right here drug produces lots of dopamine and to remember it, so as to motivate me to return to it. 



But, ya know, *I'm* personally not so worried about people's petty judgements. I struggle with methamphetamine use disorder. I'm a meth addict. A chemsex addict, in fact. I'm an imperfect, messy, emotional creature just like everybody else. And I still have worth like everybody else. I'm a complex human being like everybody else. 




My meth use says the same thing smoking weed, drinking alcohol, smoking cigs, popping pills and doing psychedelics says about someone -- nothing. So they can go on and judge like it does, but I'm perfectly secure in who I am and who I wanna be, and can show a respect for people and their complexities.



Seems to me the reason a lot of people talk about being in recovery is because they enjoy wearing it as a badge of honor. That's cool. But I'm here to say I'm still in the madness, and that's ok too. I'm deserving of the same amount of basic respect as anyone else, and maybe I'll get my hard earned break someday as well.

1ji7g2m,2025-03-24T00:57:35,Roommate cocaine/alcohol addiction?,"Hi everyone, essentially as the title states I have been dealing with issues with my roommate/friend over the past few months with drugs and alcohol (I know, alcohol is a drug). This started initially with infrequent use, maybe once a month or so with cocaine and drinking on the weekends. However, this has steadily increased to drinking throughout the week and using cocaine 3-4 days a week. Her behavior and mental health is very volatile, and I will get texts from her at 3 am that she is suicidal and wants to harm herself. She has also told me that she experiences heart arrhythmia's and the sensation of holes in her nose. 

This obviously is alarming, and I have a family history of drug use including several family members who OD'd. I know this is common, but lately I have been getting the feeling that she has been gaslighting me about this. Whenever she brings drugs into the house, she tells me she doesn't want me making her feel guilty or judged. She states that I ""stigmatize"" her by questioning her drug use or telling her I am not okay with it. She works at a harm reduction clinic and uses a lot of language to try to justify her actions. We recently got into a fight because she told me she does not hang out with me on the weekends because she want's to be able to do drugs without being judged by me, and that doing drugs doesn't make her a bad person. I feel as if all of this language is a form of gaslighting, gaslighting me into thinking I am the problem or the antagonist in this situation. In my opinion, it feels like she know's what she is doing is wrong and doesn't want to confront it. 

I am unsure of what to do in this situation. Am I the problem here for telling her I am uncomfortable with her drug use and that questioning why she is doing cocaine on a Sunday night? I don't really have the financial means to relocate right now and don't know how to really address this situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Even with my addiction I always did and still continue to respect women. I view love as a special power that can bond people like magic and make life worth living. Sex isn't #1 on priorities for a relationship. I'vr always been single and I hate it. Anyway that's I've gone so far to watch extreme porn like degrading and hardcore situations like slapping and urination. I know I've never been the fetish type I wouldn't want to do something like that in real life. I know I'm attracted to feet and I'm okay with that but everything thing else disgusts me outside of the porn experience. Lately I feel like I can't get aroused by anything anymore. I always try to have kind of like a backup of cute simple fantasies about my favorite celebrities that isn't always sex but mostly is I imagine romantic situations with my favorite female singers right now. and even without masturbation I feel something with those fantasies, however I did try to stop watching porn because of my negative feelings lately. I've went 8 days already without watching it but I feel the urge extremely right now and even during the day I've started lightly fantasizing about a singer I like and what I would do with her feet. Still nothing crazy but the urge is coming for sexual desires. I've already watched videos on how to quit. Some say to slowly ease it off and build your tolerance back up and gradually resist until you don't need it. But I want to hear from real people and I need personal advice!!

1jgvfpz,2025-03-22T05:31:39,Crack addiction graph,"

Hello,

Since the first day I smoked Crack ( Two years ago), it became a daily habit. There wasn’t a build-up, it just started and kept going. I lost a lot of money and became underweight. I dropped from 66 to 46 kilograms without even realizing it at first. I was working from home, which only made things worse. Even though my job required focus and mental sharpness, I still managed to get things done. Always last minute, somehow, but done. And that’s part of what made it dangerous. I could still perform. I could still deliver. So I kept lying to myself.

What I’ve learned is that no matter how smart I think I am, Crack is the way to hell. It doesn’t care how clever you are, how much potential you have, or how much you tell yourself you’re in control. It strips you down to nothing.

I managed to stop for a few days sometimes, but once I start again, I can’t stop. Especially with the person I was hanging out with. We were living together. I was the one who smoked it first, then we smoked together the next day. After that, it was part of the routine. Day after day.

We had a lot of problems. I was paying for everything. He couldn’t stop, not even for one day. He started acting differently. Lying constantly. The only thing he cared about was Crack. He was older than me by ten years, but I ended up being the one who took care of everything. Rent, food, damage control. It became chaos. And even though I could see it clearly, I stayed. I thought I was strong enough to handle it. I thought I could carry both of us.

I tried keeping my distance. Sometimes we would stop talking, or I would pull away, but it never lasted. We kept ending up back together. Not out of love or hope, but out of habit, out of guilt, out of that strange sense of responsibility I couldn’t explain.

Eventually, I decided to leave the city. I quit my job. Left everything behind. I spent the last six months far away. During that time, I started to feel like myself again. I ate properly, slept, and gained back over 15 kilograms. I looked healthier. I felt clearer. I thought I was done with that chapter.

But earlier this month, I came back. We saw each other again. And yes, we smoked a few times.

This time, it felt different. I didn’t even get high. All I felt was anxiety. A tight chest. Physical panic. There was no pleasure in it anymore. No illusion of escape. Just a harsh reminder that this thing still had a grip on me. And the worst part is, I already suffer from depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Crack makes all of that worse. It amplifies everything I try to manage. It replaces the high with a storm.

I don’t have trouble staying away from him now. I’m not attached in the same way I used to be. But I still worry about him. I still get thoughts like, “What if something happens to him?” Even though he did unforgivable things. Even though everyone tells me he’s just using me, that he talks badly about me, that he’s only ever taken and never given. Maybe they’re right. But I don’t hate him. I don’t love him either. I feel something in between. More like grief. not even grief for him, but for who I was around him I don't know maybe GUILT. I kept trying to be someone who could hold everything together. Someone who could fix what wasn’t theirs to fix.

I’ve always been assertive. Direct. But even with that, I’ve realized something uncomfortable. I might be too good to be true. I care too much. I give too much. Even when it’s breaking me.

I’ve started looking for a new job again. It’s been two weeks now. I’m trying to rebuild slowly, and I don’t want to fall back into what it was. I want to get back the life I had before I let all of this take over. But I know that the real recovery isn’t just physical or professional. It’s inside. It’s learning how to care without erasing yourself in the process.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking here. Maybe nothing. Maybe I just needed to write this. Maybe you’ve been there. Maybe you understand what I mean when I say that the drug isn’t even the hardest part. It’s the role you play around it. The version of yourself you become to survive it.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. I’ve been staring at this graph I made to track usage. It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than data. But now when I look at it, it feels like a journal. Like a confession. Every spike, every drop, it doesn’t just show how much I smoked. It shows when I started to disappear.

1jgyml9,2025-03-22T08:14:20,The role of choice & personal responsibility in addiction.,"When it comes to addiction, you always get treated like an ignorant asshole if you suggest “you have choices & you’re responsible for the choices you make” re: drug addiction. 
 
I’m approaching 32 now, but I spent the ages of 18-24 addicted to drugs, in & out of rehab, detox, jail, psych ward…I did all that shit, and in retrospect, I had choices and I accept responsibility for the choices I made. 

At the time I *felt* like I didn’t have a choice, because rehab indoctrinated me into believing that I had no choice, and also it was convenient for me to say “I have no choice; I have a trauma-related brain disease!” because I wanted to get high & avoid responsibility for my decision. 

I understand genuinely *feeling* powerless over addiction, but let’s be honest, we know how drugs work. We know they fuck with your mind. It’s not like I had no clue what I was signing up for when I decided to smoke a crack rock for the first time. 

That’s why I get confused when people talk about addiction as a ‘disease’ & they say it affects your neurology in such a way that ‘you feel like you need the drug to survive!!!’ 

OK sure, but you also KNOW for a fact that you DON’T need to smoke crack in order to survive. I could be high as fuck on crack & it doesn’t make me oblivious to the reality that crack-cocaine isn’t like water & it’s not actually essential for survival. 

So even if I strongly feel like I ‘need’ to buy & smoke more crack, I KNOW that I do not IN REALITY have that need. It’s just a drug-induced feeling: I feel like I ‘need’ crack only because I’ve been smoking crack, which fucks with my perception of what I need & causes me to feel like I need things that I do not, in fact, actually need. 

I knew that all along. I’m not stupid. I smoked crack on purpose. It was my choice. I chose to be a crack addict. 

Why? To get high. I loved getting high on crack. 

Why did I keep doing it despite the damage it was causing to my life? Because I was irresponsible & chose to prioritize the short-term pleasure of a crack-high over anything else that actually mattered & added fulfilment to my life. 

…I just used crack as an example, I could say the same thing for meth or benzos or alcohol or other drugs. 

TLDR — I’m sick of people assuming I’ve never been through addiction just because I don’t subscribe to the “addiction is a trauma-caused brain disease that makes you powerless over your choices” belief. It’s a choice. The feelings of powerlessness are an illusion and/or a convenient excuse to continue your addiction.

I was just coming back home in an autorickshaw after withdrawing cash from an ATM nearby and that’s when I saw this attractive girl walking on the sidewalk. 

And almost instantly, my mind flashed back to the last time I had sex, which was just recently on the 19th of March, and I found myself wondering when I’d get to experience it again.

Before I even realized it, my thoughts went further—I started imagining what she would look like naked and how it would feel to have sex with her. 

This makes me wonder if my mind is too fixated on sex, I don’t know.

1jkrlhb,2025-03-27T06:12:58,"Currently in rehab, need advice.","I am currently mandated to six months of rehab by my drug court. Yesterday, the program co-director told me that because I was doing so good, that they would talk to my legals and see if I could leave early in a couple weeks and go to a halfway house for the last three months of my mandate. 

I am currently on 24mg of Suboxone, and have been trying to get the nurse and doctors to either get me off Suboxone or to switch me to something else instead, because Suboxone no longer does anything to prevent urges after taking it for six months. They've refused at every time, and if I decide not to take it for a day or two, they flip out on me and send emails to my counselor, so I feel forced to take it daily. Eventually, I would take it and then just hold onto it until night-time and take it then, because I don't like how it makes me feel during the day because I have to go to groups. When I first took Suboxone, it was great, I had absolutely no cravings whatsoever, but after being on it for so long, it just doesn't help with that anymore.

Today, the nurse caught me trying to cheek it until night. I got told that they were kicking me off the MAT program and to not come down in the morning for it anymore. I thought whatever, no big deal. 

I get called down to the directors office today at three, and she accuses me of selling my medication to other clients, and said that she remembered that I was in her office once before begging her for another chance and that she gave it to me and now it bit her in the ass. That is a lie. I never ever have gotten in trouble here before, and I've never even been in her office before. Like I said, just yesterday they said that I was doing so good that I might be able to leave early. Now she is reporting to my legals that I am selling medication and that I am being discharged from the program, she is transferring me to a sister program in the same company of Samaritan Village.

After this happened, the nurse told every single client that came to the window to get meds that I was caught cheeking my Suboxone and she told everyone who would listen that I'm being kicked out. She told the director and every client that went to the window that she's caught me three times now, which is also not true, this is the first and only time I've been caught doing it. 

So my questions are; 

1. Is it legal for them to just cold turkey me off of medication that will give me withdrawal? 

2. Is it legal for the nurse to go around violating HIPPA laws by disclosing to clients what I take and bragging that she caught me? 

3. Is there anything I can do, like maybe call oasis, to get this rectified? Should I try calling my legals and explain what happened? 

I'm sure I have more questions but I'm tired and stressed and that's all that currently comes to mind. Any and all advice is welcomed, thank you all for your time and support. 

(Side note, if I was selling my medication, I would be going through withdrawal. I don't need to sell my medication because I have a supportive family that would send me any money I needed) ",addiction,currently mandated six months rehab drug court yesterday program codirector told good would talk legals see could leave early couple weeks go halfway house last three months mandate currently mg suboxone trying get nurse doctors either get suboxone switch something else instead suboxone longer anything prevent urges taking six months theyve refused every time decide take day two flip send emails counselor feel forced take daily eventually would take hold onto nighttime take dont like makes feel day go groups first took suboxone great absolutely cravings whatsoever long doesnt help anymore today nurse caught trying cheek night got told kicking mat program come morning anymore thought whatever big deal get called directors office today three accuses selling medication clients said remembered office begging another chance gave bit ass lie never ever gotten trouble ive never even office like said yesterday said good might able leave early reporting legals selling medication discharged program transferring sister program company samaritan village happened nurse told every single client came window get meds caught cheeking suboxone told everyone would listen im kicked told director every client went window shes caught three times also true first time ive caught questions legal cold turkey medication give withdrawal legal nurse go around violating hippa laws disclosing clients take bragging caught anything like maybe call oasis get rectified try calling legals explain happened im sure questions im tired stressed thats currently comes mind advice welcomed thank time support side note selling medication would going withdrawal dont need sell medication supportive family would send money needed,5,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jkrlhb/currently_in_rehab_need_advice/,Neutral,Moderate Concern

cz6nfd,2019-09-03T21:19:51,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

1jky0mk,2025-03-27T12:26:08,I just survived suicide. Here's my story,"Intending this to be a support post and place for people struggling with suicidal ideation to see someone's experience with it, and hopefully think about it with a new perspective. I'm 18 years old and I am a transgender woman. This is not the sole reason I felt depressed enough to take my own life, but it did contribute to it. A lot of it is self loathing - I saw myself as a horrible person, someone who ruins friendships around me, someone unlovable, someone who makes people uncomfortable without the self perspective to see that and stop it. As a family we've also been going through a terrible economic time. Our power was cut off by our energy company because we've been unable to make payments, and we're in the middle of a lengthy lawsuit with our employer. This led to me moving into a vacant flat owned by a friend. Alone. Two days after moving in, I swallowed 16 Panadol 250mg pills. The next part is a somewhat detailed description of my symptoms, so you might want to skip it. If you are considering suicide via overdose, I recommend you read, because this will happen to you if you try. Firstly, the fear set in. The realisation that I actually was going to die. Until you begin an attempt, you never actually get that feeling, and it's overwhelming. I found myself crouched on the bathroom floor, rubbing my thighs in stress, shaking uncontrollably from the caffiene in the pills, looking at the floor because the lights were too bright. I called a friend and told him I'd fucked up, and I took pills. He was going to come over that day anyway, so now he was just driving faster. 15 minutes after I took them, he arrived. At this point, I didn't have the worst symptoms, but the fear had already set in. We decided to attempt to make myself throw up. It took ages, sticking my hand down my throat, keeping my hair out of the way, and I finally vomited. It was a sickly brown and white substance, from the whiskey I'd gotten shitfaced on the night before and the Panadol respectively. But the symptoms didn't go away, it only got worse. We then decided to leave, and go to my friend's house which had more stuff and was closer to hospitals if needed. I felt incredibly queasy in the car. I threw up in a bag twice. It was yellow this time, and smelled vile. I got hot and sweaty each time I threw, and then cooled down immensly to the point of freezing and shivering. We got into the house and at this point I was pale, extremely pale. I was dizzy, my stomach hurt, my throat was on fire, my head was aching, and if I so much as moved even the slightest bit, I would nearly collapse and throw up again. The next bit lasted for 6 hours. It consisted of laying in the lap of my friend, picking up a bucket every half hour or so, painfully taking minutes to force myself to throw up, becoming incredibly hot and dizzy, then back to freezing and laying down for even sitting up was too much. I had to go to the toilet but I couldn't, I'd collapse if I got up. We got charcoal pills from a pharmacy to flush out the toxins. I had to swallow about a dozen massive, disgusting black pills which turned my vomit and saliva pitch black. I drank a solution where we mixed charcoal powder with water. It's not soluble, so I had uncomfortable fine grains of it in my mouth and teeth for hours. My teeth were black. I then had to swallow these enormous pills, about an inch across, to save my liver, or it'd fail and I'd die later if not that day. In total I threw up about 9 times to get it out of my system. Even after I finished, my stomach was still in immense pain, but I couldn't throw up any more, there was no relief. I had to sit uneasy for more hours, unable to eat, sit up, look around, go to the toilet, nothing. It was the most painful, miserable experience of my life. And I lived. I didn't die, I actually think it would have been quite difficult for me to die. Panadol, and most other pills have emetics that force you to throw up. Plus, people are closer than you think. Always. It's likely you will be saved, and then for the next hours you will suffer. So when I say it's not worth it, trust me. This happened yesterday, I'm laying in the spare bed of my friend's house having breakfast typing this, and we still need to wait and see if complications arise. Hopefully I don't have to go to a hospital because suicide is illegal and punishable in my country (as is being trans!), and I also have no health insurance, and no money to pay for treatment, both due to the economic and legal situation. How do I feel now? Happy to be alive. It made me realise I am loved, and that life is worth living, and death is far far too much effort for any benefit you get. I'll be out of this situation very soon, and hopefully be on the road to recovery. If you are to take away anything from this, it would be to reconsider. It is so, so incredibly painful to attempt suicide. Your body is literally shutting down and you are there to experience every second of it. And after you brush with death, you will realise what you will miss. You will realise who you will never see again, and how they truly feel about you, and how they will feel when you are gone.

1jl1b3s,2025-03-27T16:33:44,I'm just a worthless leech to society...,"As the title says, I'm just an angry, depressed, lazy, and worthless leech to society. Over the past few years, I've turned into a really nasty person and I'm at the point to where nothing really brings me joy anymore and everything is just hopeless. 

I lost my mom in April 2019, 3 weeks before my high school graduation. I was devastated and my mental health went on a steep decline. Had to move to my grandparents on my mom's side, which weren't really emotionally supportive and would often ridicule me for behaving a certain way. 

Then my brother, who is my half brother, had to move across the country to live with his abusive dad because he was a minor at the time and the courts ruled that he should be with his father. Knowing what his dad did to my mom, it's sickens me to think about the fact that he has my brother now. But maybe I'm just overreacting because he seems to be doing well. 

Went to college in the fall semester and things went left quickly. I was so depressed that I didn't bother showing up to classes, I would spend my financially refund on a bunch of junk food just to keep my mind occupied from the depression. I was also a huge slob and would barely clean up my room, to the point where I would have my RA constantly held me for having a dirty dorm, as well as my roommate who would complain to me about the very same thing. I just didn't care about anything. 

Often posted about how suicidal I was on social media to the point where police would regularly knock on my door to check on me. Now, every time someone knocks, I can't help but feel my heart begin to race rapidly. 

Covid hit and eventually I had to move back to my grandparents, who we're still emotionally unsupportive and constantly Express how lazy I am for not getting a job, which is fair and all honesty but it didn't make me feel good at the time. It got to where the environment just got two toxic, but I couldn't go back to school because my grades were so low after that spring semester that I lost my scholarships and couldn't go back to my university. 

So in 2021, I told him that I would be moving back to my school but instead I just moved away from my grandparents and took a bus to a different city and stayed at a homeless shelter there. Eventually my dad found me and wanted me to move in with him, which I was hesited at first because it didn't know my dad very well (it took him 13 years to get the milk) but knowing that I had no other option I went with him. Gave me a year to save up enough money to get into my own apartment. Then when time was up, I told him that I found an apartment but I really didn't because I would spend all of my paycheck within the weekend ordering DoorDash and Uber Eats.

Dad eventually found out about it and told my grandparents who were also disappointed, let me stay in his residence for another year but with stricter rules. Rules that I honestly didn't like because it made me feel like a child. Then one day, my dad just went missing. Stop showing up to work, stopped coming home, no one knew where he was. His phone cut off, his bosses couldn't find them, no one. I was living in his apartment and because he pays most of the rent and bills there, I knew I couldn't stay there for long so I found a room to stay in at a house. 

Of course, my grandparents were worried but also kind of blamed his disappearance on me. Then started blaming me for other stuff that was unrelated to the disappearance. To be fair, at this point I'm a compulsive liar, so maybe it was deserved but I ended up cutting my extended family off after being told that I've done nothing with my life ever since I graduated high school. I've wasted 4 years of my life  accomplishing nothing. It set me off so bad to the points of where I just ended contact with them. 

So after a year, in 2024 at this point, I started applying the jobs because the job that I was at sucked. I found a job and even had orientation set up and everything, but I messed up because I couldn't find my ID and I needed my ID for I-9 documents. So instead of showing up to my new job explaining to them about the situation, I ended up not going and completely wasting the new opportunity I was given. At the time, I had also put in my two weeks and my first day of my new job was the day after the last day of my old job. Eventually I ran out of money and had to move out of the room that I was staying in, leaving me homeless for about 5 months. 

At first I kind of accepted that this was my life, and that's I would never go anywhere, but then silly old me decided to get help and got accepted into a rapid rehousing program which was cool. I could finally make progress in my life and work towards getting into the tech field. 

Fast forward to now, and I have barely made any progress with anything. Work is so hard to find and consistently waking up to denied job applications and not making money became tiring. Also, experiencing more mental health issues, which I've come to accept as a part of me now. 

Normally I would just soak and mope about the bleak situation that I'm in now, but then recently I started to realize that I kind of had this coming to me. I've lied to people multiple times. I have emotionally hurt people and push people away because of my suicidal ideation. I'm also lazy because there's some opportunities that I could have taken but just didn't. Also, I'm trying to get into a field that is becoming more and more oversaturated without even a college degree. Lately I've just been thinking of myself, I'm fucked. And maybe that's for the better. 

I've noticed in life that I can't just keep blaming things on other events. Yes, my mom's passing was a tragedy, but everything after that was kind of my fault. I was the one who flunked myself out of university, after getting full ride scholarships. I was the one who lied to my family over and over again. I was the one who stayed in a shitty dead end job doing shit that I hated. I was the one who got myself homeless, and for the record I've been homeless multiple times at this point. I am the one who isn't getting employed, and keeps backing out on opportunities more employment. I've come to realize, I'm the problem. I just can't seem to hardwire my brain into fixing the problems and doing what I need to do. 

Honestly? A part of me is fine with this. I don't think I was meant to be successful in the first place. Success isn't even possible for me anymore, and it's totally my fault. I accept that it's my fault. I pushed away all my friends and family, I'm all alone and I just don't have anyone who I can really trust anymore. Therapy doesn't work. Making friendships doesn't work. I don't feel comfortable with anyone anymore. I kind of had this coming for a while. My situation is just the result of all of my mistakes in the past.

The worst part is, there are two ways that I can fix it. I can fix it by either going through with my plans to become successful and eventually be a functioning member society, or I can go through with the suicidal ideation that's been in my head for years now. I'm too lazy to do the former and too much of a coward to do the latter. So I'm just left with the third option: to just stop crying about it and accept it.

A part of me doesn't even want to be successful anymore. I feel like there were some things that I didn't have to stress about well being homeless. When you're at rock bottom and have nothing to lose, it's hard to really feel stressed. It's a feeling of ""I know my place"", If that makes sense. 

Also, with my extreme anxiety and major depressive disorder, I don't think this world is meant for people like me anyway. I hate saying that out loud because it sounds like an excuse, but when it gets to where both disorders are severely impacting me to the point of deabilitation, I have to start questioning things. How can I survive in a world like this? I can't. Everything is too overwhelming for me. Everything is just too much for me to handle, and I feel like someone like me just isn't meant to be a functioning member of society. I'll be a leash until the day I die. It's an unfortunate reality, but it's something that I need to embrace and accept.

1jl2qud,2025-03-27T17:58:45,Sack of shit like me deserves to die.,"Recently gave education another go only to realize I’m not cut out for it again. I didn’t want to admit it to my parents because they slightly helped me out with some expenses for it. I tried to push through deadlines and studying for exams, but at this rate I don’t think I’ll even pass. I thought it was best to just keep it to myself and not tell my parents that I’m going to fail this semester. I know they probably wouldn’t had cared if I hadn’t said anything but I told them because I don’t want to feel like I’m lying to them. I only told my mother and she didn’t take it very well. Back then, I had a job and quit a second time (Barely 3 months) because it fucked with me mentally. I’m just a dirty fucking quitter, failure, lazy, and ungrateful. 


My parents probably see me as a burden to them after all the stress through past arguments I had put them through. I tried to push regardless, but I just can’t anymore, I just want to die. I look back at my elementary-high school life and remember the times I didn’t have to worry that much about where I wanted to be in life, because I was always good at school since I felt a responsibility to continue working. When in college, I didn’t felt that at all. I probably should’ve just shut my mouth and not said a thing, but now they know how ungrateful I really am. My parent’s relationship status isn’t even that great, we had an argument and they told me that they didn’t really love each other. 

This isn’t really the only reasons why I feel this way. I mean, I kept getting complaints from customers about how I suck at my job, eventually getting to me. There was never a day after the first month that I didn’t fuck up. I even had a previous job and quit that one because nobody cared to train me. I tried therapy but eventually I couldn’t keep affording it.

I’m not sure what I would even do if they eventually divorced each other. The only thing I just kept thinking about is leaving the house and killing myself. I get that I’m supposed to keep pushing anyways, but as dumb as it sounds, I don’t even know why I keep pushing. I don’t know what I’m even doing anymore. I’m sorry if I someday went through with it. 

I know I’ll probably keep suffering after this post, but I just can’t bear it any longer.

1jguaci,2025-03-22T04:38:18,i did it,"f16, and it’s been about six hours since I’ve consumed 1500 mg of iron pills. I’m currently in the bathroom, waiting out my incoming vomit. And… it feels weird. Like, I actually did it, and this is all real. After years of failed attempts, I really feel like this is the one. This wasn’t how I imagined I would go through, because I’ve always wanted it to be quick and painless… and I know that this process will be anything but that. So, I’m anticipating for the next few hours that I’ll be in real pain before I really pass away. And I’m scared. I haven’t even thought about writing my letters. Ehhh… don’t think I want to. So… I’m writing this because… I don’t know… this is such a weird epiphany I’m having. Feels like I’m having post-nut clarity ngl. I don’t have the words right now, but I’m just so mindblown that it has really come to this. And me, a coward, is surprised that I actually did it. Thought I’d chicken out, like stopping when I got half-way through. But I’ll finally have the relief that it’s all going to be over soon. Even if I somehow manage to survive this, I do hope that I’ll be left physically scarred forever. I think I deserve it.

update: Hi guys. So, it's been awhile. During my hours of absence on Reddit, it’s been,,,, uhhh,,,,,,, miserable. Very. Do I regret it? Well… I don't want to frustrate you guys, but I'm going to be completely honest that I don't. Atleast, not yet. I also saw a comment about my weight, and I thought I'd provide a little more context that I am 39 kg and my BMI falls in the underweight category. Anyway… as for my physical well-being, I’m currently experiencing all the symptoms. Nonstop vomiting and nausea, World War 3 in the bathroom, gut-wrenching body pain, dehydration, dizziness, fatigue… one bad moment was when my chest started to ache really badly. I had to stop everything that I was doing because it was just so painful. My heart was pounding, and it was difficult to breathe. It was BAD BAD. Like… painful enough that I totally thought I was going to die right there. I already had that lingering pain for a while since I overdosed, but it just got serious at that moment. And I still feel it. There are bruises forming on my legs. I feel heavy whenever I stand up/walk. My abdomen is in agony and I feel like I’m going to puke the whole thing out. My sides where my kidneys are is in pain. Aching and cramping and soring all at the same time. Fortunately, the pain died down as of this moment, but it’s still there. Even the littlest movements prove to me that it’s still there. As for help, I haven’t told anyone yet. My mom had noticed some of my symptoms, but I just joked to her, saying that I just ate bad food or something. I just wanted a break. Everything is so painful. I can’t do anything. I can’t think clearly. All I can do is crumple on my bed, whimpering and sulking in the very very very painful mess I put myself in. I’ll try dragging this out some more until I really can’t handle it anymore. And yes, I know that it’ll get worse. I’ll see when I can update, IF I do go to the hospital. And thank you all for your concerns and insights and knowledge about the situation. I really appreciate it. I have been reading them very carefully, each one of them.

1ji5sn2,2025-03-23T23:47:59,We lost our son and I suspect she’s having an affair,"My wife and I have been married for about 1 year. She is a ‘33F’ and I’m a ‘32M’. We were together for about 3 years but we’re best friends growing up since we were little kids. During our relationship, I sacrificed my career and home to be with her. 

We were 6 months pregnant with our baby boy. We had abrupt complications late in the pregnancy which resulted in my wife going into emergency surgery. We lost the baby. Our son didn’t survive. 

I understand grieving can come in all sorts of different ways. I’m not perfect but I always did my best to show my wife love and support. Some unhealthy ways of coping that I did was burying myself in video games, taking long hours in the gym, ignoring family and friends so I can cry alone. But I always made sure I take time to give attention to my wife and love her through this tragedy. 

After a few weeks have passed, my wife had changed. She’s very angry, abusive, and short tempered. She truly believes everything was my fault. She blames me for the death of our child. She thinks something is genetically wrong with me or that I have bad karma that affected our son. Then she mentions the idea of divorce. She thinks this might be a divine sign that we’re not meant to be together. 

Now I’ve noticed she’s extremely protective of her phone. Every time I’m nearby she’s trying to hide her screen away from me. I also notice she deletes messages when I’m nearby. She also sleeps with her phone under her pillow. 

She was recently invited to attend a wedding in Hawaii. But I was not invited. I was told the venue was too small to accommodate significant others. So I didn’t think much of it. But I offered to still come to Hawaii with her so we can rekindle and bond together. For some reason she was very reluctant on having me stay home. She tried very hard to have me not come to Hawaii with her for some reason. I eventually talked her into agreeing that I come so we can mourn our son and heal together. 

However, she tells me we’re going to stay in different hotels because she has to stay in her sister’s hotel room to be close and be a part of the wedding party. During the trip, she ignores me text messages, doesn’t pick up the phone. She would occasionally send me random food pictures or scenery pictures to make it appear she’s not totally ignoring me. But when I later confront her on it, she told me she didn’t have time to read my messages because she was “involved” with the wedding stuff. It threw me off guard because the wedding had no groomsmen, no best man, no bridesmaids, and no maid of honor. She had no responsibility in her friend’s wedding. 

I’m sitting alone in a hotel room with my mind racing in dark places….

I feel like I’m going crazy. It feels like I’m not allowed to mourn for my son and now I feel like I’m mourning my marriage. This isn’t fair to my son. I feel like I’ve upheld my wedding vows and did everything right as a man and husband. I’m not sure what to do or how to navigate. 

How can I approach her to have a healthy conversation about this? What are some things that I need to ask to appropriately navigate this? I feel like my world is ending.

It must have been about a half dozen times ""old mate"" shall we call him down the hallway has set off the smoke alarm at 2am, which means by law, here in Australia it now sets off every smoke alarm in the building through interconnected smoke alarms.

I'm about to lose my shit entirely... The guy is toxic as fuck and it's beyond all reasoning with him, property managment have already raised the issue with him...

I give up, even when I try to move my life forward I run into this shit.

When I called a help line about the consistency of it all they engaged in was DBT style cognitive reframing, and making it about me, rather than him, which is nothing more than gaslighting... which leads to more negative transference and counter transference... which means my mood is now fucked also.

1jgzfwc,2025-03-22T08:58:51,What is there for me? I don't know how to be a proper human.,"I’ve planned to end my life before adulthood claims me.

I really didn't think the time would come where I could ask strangers online for help, but it seems like there is no other option for me. I'm turning 18 in a few months, expected to stand and act like a proper human being but I don't even feel like I belong here. It's like my reflection is a stranger. Who is that? How did she end up here? I blame myself, but I know this pain started long before I could control it. I don't even know how to start, how to take my first steps into adulthood without tripping and ruining my whole life by doing something wrong.

I am very mentally ill but I don't get any kind of help. I hate being a “narcissist” (it runs in the family, but I promise you I have never hurt anyone as I would hate myself for it, being diagnosed with NPD feels like a life sentence. I’m hyperaware of every thought, terrified I’ll become what others accuse me of—even though I’ve done nothing wrong) and having a persistent depression disorder. Do my parents support me and try to help me with my declining mental health? Well, not really, they are against therapy, psychologists and medication.

What would they do anyways? If they didn't care when my older brother sexually assaulted me when I was 15 back then so I know they won't even try. I'm a wilted plant no one bothers to water in this family, so why keep fighting to bloom? The trust issues and fear makes me feel constantly alert. My own home is too overwhelming, my head hurts. Too anxious and nauseous to keep up. I never had privacy or respect so each time someone approaches my door my heart beats fast and I feel pain in one side of my abdomen.

This gut feeling is killing me, having an open door won't let me sleep. The only time I feel calm it's when everyone is asleep and I can just spend some time by myself. Funny, isn't it? I jolt awake at 3 a.m., my pillow soaked in tears I don’t remember crying. Somehow my chest aches like I’ve been mourning someone, but I don’t know who. I'm mourning for my future? My hopes? My dreams? Pretty sure these are already rotting in the corner of my room.

I've had these constant thoughts about ending my life on my birthday or cutting my throat in front of my family for years. I want to make them see my pain, even if it’s too late. You know, even if I hate living, I’m terrified of dying. Part of me still clings to hope like a life raft, telling myself stuff such as: “maybe things will get better”, “maybe I'm just exaggerating”, “everything is going to be alright”. But deep down I know it hardly will. To be honest, I was a neglected child when it came to self-care, so I don't know how to do a lot of basic things like other people my age. I mean, taking care of myself feels like trying to solve a math problem in a language I don’t speak, meanwhile other teenagers are genius prodigies that got most of their lives solved.

How do people do it? It feels like everything I do is a punishment, and I'm at my wit's end. I only have two friends but I'm tired of faking this happy silly persona I have developed through the years, maybe they're the only reason I am still alive right now. Why does it feel like this? Why does it feel like there’s thick glass between me and the world? I can see people laughing and moving, but I can’t touch or join them, as if I am stuck in my own skin. This isn't me but I know it's who I am supposed to be at the moment. I need to figure out the answer before I decide the date for my suicide. I feel selfish, I love them and they love me back but I don't think I can keep up with my promises. 

How funny, my body is a hollow shell. My thoughts echo inside like screams in an empty room. This empty room is like my life. How do I build a life when I don’t even know my own edges?

1jibefa,2025-03-24T03:47:51,It's over,"My dog is dying as I'm typing, I'm keeping an eye on her and I don't know if she will survive the night (she dropped on the ground, stopped breathing and started shitting herself this morning, I've spent 3 hours to the vet but the surgery (her liver almost collapsed and she had 230ml of blood pressing her heart) has only given me some more time with her. She was supposed to get up on her legs after the anesthesia wore off, but she didn't, she passed the whole afternoon and evening on her bed, refusing even to drink.

She is the only reason I have to keep on going, and now even this reason is coming to an end. By tomorrow, I'll be alone, in a place that I hate, surrounded by people I don't like and with no way out.

If I'm on the side of the living by next week, I'll update this post.

So long.



UPDATE: This morning she has been a bit more reactive: she sat, ate and drank (but I had to bring food and water to her) something. With a bit of encouragement and a bit of help she also walked outside and did all her stuff on her own.

I've just came back from the vet and he said that she's... fine, and that he doesn't want to change my mind but that he wouldn't suggest me to euthanize her considering her current conditions, so she's still with me. This evening I'll go to another vet for an ecodoppler to confirm if she has cancer and then we'll decide if putting her down there or giving her some meds to let her live a long as she's willing to fight.



UPDATE 2: Just came out from the veterinarian: she has a cancer of 2,5cm of diameter on her heart. The prognosis is that thinking she'll live another month is hugely optimistic, she will die in probably less than a week from one of these three possible outcomes: 1) the cancer starts spilling blood in her myocardium once again and I'll have to put her down. 2) the cancer starts spilling blood in her myocardium once again, cause a stroke (her heart is very weak right now) and she'll go away gently and with no stress. 3) Her heart fails on its own, she dies gently and with no stress.

1jhmca0,2025-03-23T05:28:57,30 seconds.,"That's all I need. That's all I fucking need. Just thirty seconds unsupervised in a room with a loaded gun. The first ten will be scrambling to get it and turn the safety off. The last twenty are putting it in my teeth, getting the angle right and working up the courage to pull the trigger without flinching.

I'm not even depressed anymore. I'm not sad or empty or apathetic. I'm just tired. It's not that I don't think I have any future or that things aren't going to get better or that I'm unlovable or worthless or any other garbage. I just don't want to be around to see any of it. If you've suffered the way I have, I'm inclined to think you'd agree. Living and getting to a ""better place"" is going to cost me so much time, effort, money, pain, and I simply don't think it's worth it. 

What's the point? Sincerely? It's impossible to ever be happy with my mental health conditions. I don't feel emotions like normal people, my brain structure is physiologically different, it makes it impossible to enjoy anything as much as the average person. I could become a millionaire, an acclaimed celebrity, a revolutionary public figure, and I still wouldn't gaf. 

Moreover, what is so wrong with suicide? No one in my life has ever given me a half decent response as to why it would legitimately be a bad thing. I'm not ""suffering"" with these thoughts, they're the only thoughts that make me feel anything similar to happiness. Suffering is what I go through every second I'm not dead. I've barely been alive for the past 4 years, but it'd somehow be worse to actually be dead? 

It's condescending, infantilizing, ableist, and frankly, doesn't actually help anyone. Are YOU going to help me? Pay for my therapy? Hold my hand when I have another PTSD attack? Actually aid me in fixing my life in the slightest? No? I didn't think so. All you could possibly offer me is manipulating me into somehow thinking there's any worth in life. Useless. I used to be angry at the world for being so thoroughly corrupt, depraved and degenerate- I don't even care anymore. Let them keep killing, torturing and maiming each other, it's what humanity does best. 

I'm not one to believe in ableist notions of intelligence, but goddamn, life is gonna make a believer out of me yet. Not a critical thought to be found in 90% of human skulls worldwide. All their heads are good for is taking in the oxygen they waste before going about their pointless lives, deluded into the notion that they're somehow on a functional capacity greater than a golden retriever. If they're not murders, rapists, human traffickers, drug dealers, politically corrupt hedonists, abusers, manipulators, or any other atrocious lifeform, they're enablers of those who are. 

As far as religion goes, no I don't care if I suffer in the afterlife. Literally nothing would be different in that respect, but at least I'd finally be alone. That's all I want. People are my hell and at least there, I'd get to hear their agony as they get what they deserve for all eternity. 

I've screamed for help for years and no one answered. I lost everything that made life worth living. My mind is made up now. I'm done. Just let me rot already.

I've always wanted this to start , I've been dreaming alot and for as long as I could live I learnt to appreciate every moment,  unknowing of what could've happened next. 
Every path I follow there's always a spike to step on, I'm always betrayed, humiliated you name it, every single thing that hurts have happened to me.

I wanted to stop talking, to stop speaking , to stop being nice , I don't know why I card,  why do I care?.
I was never Human, and I never will be, whatever responsibilities my friends risk , makes my heart sick ,and why? At what cost would you hurt me for? I remember goodness more than the monstrosity of what people have caused and done to me , yet I see light deep within.

Even at moment where I'm surprised to hear your laughter, the dimples showing on your cheeks and a sense of happiness happier than when you were with me , when I closed my door waiting for you to knock , you haven't knocked and I thought it was my fault for keeping the door close and even when opened , like the same nobody came in. Am no burden to carry but the more I've spoke the more I felt sticky , I felt like a gum under their shoe. I will forever be a baby that cries in its mothers crib ,when not heard it stops. I thought I was the only person who watches those tears falling down your eyes and your eyes torn out from the exhaustion , when I wipe it with my own hands , that wasn't enough to remmeber, when I held you close. 
At what cost?.

I've loved you , I love and I can't stop loving, I want this to end , I want this pain to end , nothing makes me happy. My friends , abandoned me and left me badly wounded. So did my family , I don't even deserve to write this suicide letter ,nones ever gonna read it from my group.

I'm a coward , a big stupid coward, days pass, I miss the people who I barely ever talk to , I give my time to everyone I love , I felt at this moment  that no matter what I've done , there's something else that should be done , am I selfish for giving my flesh and not giving my bones ? 

Have no one been fair to me , I'm cursed to be this way , I'm cursed to be like this , I'm meant to be lonely , I'm meant to die. 

I'd rather be an animal , I'd rather be dead , death will have more mercy.

Right before his birthday, before i found out i was already making plans for his bday and he told me he wasnt gonna celebrate his birthday, and now i know why.

I havent known him for so long, but meeting him got me over my depression and ive never been happier than this. Everyday we play together and theres this like equal craving between us to spend time with each other, he's already told me he was trying to get healthier so he could spend more time with me.

He has tons of internal struggles, things i havent experienced and all i want is to change his mind, i don't want him to miss out on all of the amazing things life has to offer because life is the ONLY time we could ever feel something and experience something. I dont know if i should adress his struggles and somehow convince him that it gets better, i dont know how it feels to be transgender and not being accepted by your whole family.

Hes young, planning to kill himself the night before his 16th birthday (8th april). All i want is to prevent it or just prolong it, and its not even in a selfish manner its not for ME its because i want HIM to live HIS life for himself. All he wants to stay alive for right now is me, and i hate that i might be the reason he might still be alive soon. Because what if i fail? everyone ive ever loved have been suicidal including my mother, its a guilt i dont wish upon anyone.

I think about my friends and family, how they would react, what they would say. I think about how I would do it. I would wait for my parents to go out of town, which they do regularly. I would get some pills, which I’ve already gotten a contact for, and a bottle of vodka. I’m broke as fuck but I’ve got my little suicide cash stash for this in my piggy bank I have from when I was a kid. I’d write the letters, one for my sister, one for my parents, and one each for my two closest friends. I’d leave my necklace to my sister, my friend’s old broken claw clip I kept from when I met her to her, and my other friend’s lighter I stole to her. 

I think about it all the time. It feels like the only thing that could make things right. I’ve never really been happy since I was a kid, and I don’t think I ever can be. I’m not built for this. I’ve never been able to do anything right, I’ve never been able to handle anything on my own. I’m not a good person.

When depression is chronic, it can feel like there’s no end to the suffering, and dismissing it as a passing phase only makes people feel more misunderstood and alone.

The reality is, some people struggle with depression despite therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and every other possible effort. 

Instead of minimizing their pain with clichés, people should acknowledge how heavy that burden is and focus on real, compassionate support.

It is weird. I have thought about suicide for so long (since I am 17). Every single time, I agreed is the logical thing to do.

I will make a comprehensive suicide note that explains that there's nothing they could do and don't blame themselves for my death. Then and only then, I will kill myself by carbon monoxide poisoning. 

It is flawless, but why I am crying?

All my life has been in service of other people. I have no joy except for some dopamine just to keep on surviving. Life is an endless struggle. The only way to be free is to not be alive.

I clearly do not see what others see in all this no matter how it is explained.  Hearing about marriage and family planning from anyone makes me the most ill/uncomfortable.  I don’t understand why anyone wants to get a boyfriend/girlfriend/partner, get engaged, get married, have kids, advance career, buy new house, get more money, give to the kids, take kids to school, bathe them, clothe them, feed them, play with them, educate them, praise them, punish them, go on vacation, celebrate milestones, wait till they leave the nest, live until your mind/body gives out, the end.  The same pipeline over and over and over again.  This life is not worth continuing to me, and it sure isn’t worth it to procreate besides “contributing to society” or uplifting a new productive member of society or spreading “love”.  What a bunch of bs.  It’s just something I will never understand.  I hate the happy accident thing too.  I don’t like imagining it as a turn of events.  All you did was have unprotected sex and fast forward to the present you have 1 2 3 4 5 and everything is all hunky dory (or not) and you are making breakfast in the morning for your family for years and years to come.  You shape it into your happy little family, facebook photos and all.  It is like a Disney sitcom with the dad, mom, older brother, sister, younger brother, toddler, baby.  More or less.  It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth even though I can’t properly explain how much it irks me.  It is my worst nightmare.  I would never want to be pregnant.  Even single parents that wanted it that way, I will never understand it.  I will never understand the Rachel Green’s of the world with crazy baby fever.  I will never understand the dads that go with the flow and do what their wife ultimately wants and vice versa.  I would never want to go through any of that.  I don’t know why people want to do that to themselves.  I don’t know why people find it fulfilling.  It makes me feel crazy seeing everyone around me either already have a family or wanting to start a family or in the process.  It keeps me up at night.  I can’t get sleep over it sometimes.  It’s like almost every person I meet has some kind of egg in the basket of family planning.  I see children everywhere.  It makes me sad looking at their faces knowing that some of them will eventually be looked at like failures.  Some of them will develop addiction, some of them will get abused, some of them will go through something very traumatic, some of them will die young, some of them will never feel like they belong.  Some of them are born disabled or will soon come to be.  Some of them may want to kill themselves.  It’s all about the children until it’s not anymore.  Pregnant young women get paraded around until it’s all over.  Until everyone grows up and moves on.  Passing of the torch, for what?  A cure to cancer?  World peace?  Nobody goes hungry?  A McDonald’s Cheeseburger?  Feeling the sun on your face?  Seeing someone smile?  Seeing someone laugh?  Giving back? Having hope? Sure.

Before anyone asks, I work as a retail manager full-time while going to school. My boyfriend is also a manager in his career field. We have some animals, but no kids. We have financial security and freedom for the most part, so that’s not really a big factor in this. I have a good support system and some close friends, so it’s not like I’m lonely or anything like that… I just don’t believe that living day-to-day is enjoyable like it used to be when I was young. It’s actually utterly and indescribably miserable for me these days…. I thought it would be better bc I would have more freedom, but it actually really sucks.. 

People love to say that you have the most energy in your 20’s, and life is what you make it… but I always feel drained 24/7.

1jkycju,2025-03-27T12:50:33,I’m Thinking of Killing Myself…Again…,"The voices are getting louder and the light is fading away…

Usually, people that are suicidal tend to be dealing with extreme circumstances in life (e.g. illness, bullying, abuse, etc), but surprisingly this isn’t the case for me. 
Fortunately, I haven’t had any ‘traumatic’ experiences in life, but something just never felt right. For a long time I felt like my depression was invalid because nothing “bad” had happened to me, and that I would just be perceived as a ‘pick me’ or a ‘spoilt brat’ if I ever spoke about it. 
So, I just kept it inside and would harm myself in silence…

I’m not sure if anyone can relate, but I just feel so fucking empty inside man. Like absolutely fucking empty inside. I feel like I have no purpose and no drive to do anything. 
I always ask myself “Why am I here?” 
I never feel like I belong anywhere, not even with my family. Even when surrounded by my loved ones I feel so empty and life feels meaningless. It’s like nothing or no one can “save me”.

And it’s kinda hard to comprehend because I genuinely am a good girl. 4.0 gpa, working on my Master’s degree, homebody, doesn’t do drugs, small circle of friends, loving family, in good health, etc.
So I feel like I have no reason to feel like this, but idk something just never felt right and I just felt like I was going through life rather than living it. 

I’m about to be 25 and I genuinely don’t think I can do it anymore. I’m not happy, I’m empty. Life is dull and meaningless. When I was a teenager I always thought things would “get better” but they never do. I still have the deep scars on my body which signify how long I’ve been fighting these demons. It’s to the point where I don’t even care who would be sad if I’m gone, because I genuinely just can’t keep living like this.

I’m sorry, I tried,
But I just can’t keep fighting anymore 
I don’t have it in me anymore, I’m tired
I just wanna go to sleep… forever…

I've been dragging myself through hell trying to be good at my job for over a year now, always jumping through hoops to try to appease a very difficult boss and always coming up short. All I ever wanted was to work in vet med and now I'm here and I love it but I also just feel so useless the whole time. Maybe my life's goal isn't for me at all no matter how hard I try. I feel directionless and like I've failed despite my very best attempts to be good at life. 

I want to have success, I want to love my career, I want to make enough money to move my wife and I out of this shitty apartment and into our first home. I just want to feel like I'm not in the way of everyone else. 

I feel so far behind other people my age and I never fit in anywhere. I'm convinced everyone secretly hates me or thinks it's funny to pretend to be my friend and the second I'm gone they're just laughing about how dumb I am or how much they hate me. I just feel generally incompatible with being alive and that's terribly selfish because logically I know all those thoughts are just the unfortunate fact I'm mentally ill and people do care about me but... it's hard to just dismiss the constant stream of depreciating thoughts and rising urge to find a way to die. 

I'm scared of myself and I'm scared of disappointing people who love me. Getting help is so hard too. I recently had to get my own insurance and naturally it's not very good because I couldn't afford anything beyond the basics. Therapy isn't covered and I've considered many times recently just going to the ER because I have no idea what else to do when I'm pretty sure I'm about to actually do something but that's also such a point of anxiety because of the horror stories you hear about those places making people worse or forcing them to stay against their will. 

All this to say I just wish I was normal. The way I am, my personality and my brain's wiring is just wrong and bad from what I can tell. I wish I was normal and I could work the 40+ hour work week without being so tired I can hardly get myself to eat or shower. I wish I was normal and social interactions came naturally. I wish I was normal and didn't have to deal with the constant fear of my identity putting a target on my back and the constant stream of legal attacks on me as a human person.

1jl4ffk,2025-03-27T19:23:48,My therapist only wants to talk about himself,"This story will sound a bit out there I understand if people find it hard to believe. Anyway, I started going back to therapy as per request of my psychiatrist and saw a male therapist it wasn’t by choice but I didn’t care either way. I let him know from the get go that I have had bad experiences with therapists just yapping about their lives and it was the main reason I had quit therapy previously. 

The first session went fairly normally and so I came back for a second. In this session, he kept talking about how he had been to a club the night before and how he had a lot of women around him and so on. He told me that his type of women is ‘sexual siren women’ and went on to talk about how there are different subtypes of women and men. I had mentioned my diagnosis of cyclothymia (bipolar III) and how I had made a friend during a hypomanic episode, and he told me I should just act more like my manic self then to be more confident. I had also mentioned my lack of interest when interacting with people and he told me to stop being selfish, after using my therapy session to talk about how many women he pulled at the club of whatever. 

I went back for a 3rd session but only because I had forgotten to cancel in time and didn’t want to pay a late cancellation fee. Decided to try make the best use of it and brought up issues related to my mental illnesses I wanted to discuss. He said they were merely quirks and that I was ‘scary’ after talking about them. He then went back to talking about himself just as the last time. He made sexist assumptions about me anytime I tried to bring the session back to well myself because it’s MY therapy making comments like ‘as a woman you are already predisposed to bipolar behavior because of your period’ ??? I was thoroughly pissed off by the sheer incompetence and lack of professionalism of this guy. Anytime I tried to talk or stand up for myself against the shit he was saying he would interrupt me just to continue talking about himself. To top it off he told me he thinks one of his clients mothers was flirting with him/had a crush on him and then told me it was because she had called him after her son got arrested and for some reason he took her being in an obviously stressful situation and needing someone reliable like you know her sons therapist for assistance as flirting?? I had wasted 40 minutes of my time driving there and back as well as the hour and a half session (supposed to be an hour but he just loves talking about himself so much). I’m entirely pissed off over this experience. 

I’m thinking of quitting therapy again. I don’t know if it’s normal for my therapist to talk so much about themselves it has been my experience with the past 3 I have seen. None lasted more than two sessions and this has been my worst experience yet.

It's been difficult. Just made a post about that some time ago here. The thing is that, out of the few things we've talked about, I talked her a bit about videogames and stuff. She then suggested we use them in the therapy, and suggested that the next session (tomorrow) I should bring any game I like to play in the session or something.

Shit, I just- don't know. This therapy has been absolute hell for me, and honestly I dread going to any session. And it's not because of the therapist, I think she's great I guess. She has been very kind and patient with me. It's just that my life is an absolute mess right now and I've been considering suicide a lot again, and I guess the thought of going there and to just play videogames is... silly? A waste of time? Don't know how to describe it. Before anyone says that I should mention these suicidal thoughts, I don't think I trust her THAT much right now.

Not only that, the games I play are mostly on PC or console and it's not like I could bring any of those to the session, hah. And I don't play that much on my phone, which is the only thing I bring there- I swear this sounds so silly now I write it up lol.

1jkivjw,2025-03-26T23:58:38,My therapist gave me the ick...,"Some background... I have a ton of trauma from the lifestyle I lived for the last 10 years. I was an addict and I was a pretty big drug dealer working for some pretty bad people. Not my proudest moment and getting arrested saved my life and I got sober. I have been sober for over 2 years now. So I went to my second therapist after trying therapy in January. 

The first one instilled doubt in me when she asked me questions that were not necessary to treating me for trauma. It made me think that she was a cop and I almost shut down... She was asking me about things like if I transported drugs over state lines and if I ever went to Mexico and stuff that was unnecessary. So since the seed of doubt was planted I switched therapists. 

The next therapist was a man and I've seen him 3 times as of today. My initial intake and 2 sessions. At our first meeting he was saying that I ""had a unique look, meaning my skin tone was nice""... Weird but ok. 

At our second session he said ""no disrespect but you are an attractive woman. I've had other light skinned women that were attractive that had low self esteem and I couldn't understand why they thought this way"". This was right after he asked me about my past relationships and which ones had been healthy. Meaning no abuse (physical, mental or psychological) and where no drugs were involved. To which I responded zero. 

The. He of course said I have a lot, a lot of trauma and I was like, well duh!! Then he was saying I need to ""completely surrender"" so that he could help me and that after the other statement made me kinda get the ick. 

As we finished up the session he said ""next session I want to talk about just you so I can get to know you as a person."" I left that appointment feeling really weird and not really wanting to go back.

Am I being too picky or am I justified, for a lack of better word, in wanting to change again.

Unfortunately my father is number 1 trigger. The area he lives in (where I grew up) is also my trigger. I have tried to prove to myself for the last 10 years he is not, but every time I am around him too often my addict tendencies creep up on me.


Otherwise I am completely fine, won’t even think about anything addiction related. 


However, I am in a position where it would be beneficial to be around him for two days of the week. He needs help in his ageing process.

1jknmcm,2025-03-27T03:14:53,Negative Therapist Experience. Anyone else?,"I am not depressed or anxious. Use to be but I am not due to being my own therapist and intentionally treating these conditions nyself. I have struggled with things I think fall under the category of a neurodivergent condition. I have had such a sour experience with mental health professionals and even the receptionist I speak with initially when I call for information.

Firstly back when I was struggling with anxiety I got free counselling through my school that was online. She was late. I was explaining how it stems from childhood experiences and so on and crying. And mind you this lady is a white woman and I am not (its relevant) but she kept asking me if I experience a lot of racism and if thats where it comes from meanwhile I am clearly explaining its from childhood experiences. She kept bringing up race like a weirdo and suggest I talk to a group that specializes in therapy for people of my race. It was so weird.


Second lady I saw to manage some symptoms of like executive dysfunction etc and she was the same race as me so Im thinking I won't have that experience again. Again its online and first session she is late??? Like really late I had to call her for her to log on. Barely any intro or explanation and she's asking me vague open ended questions. The first impression made it difficult for me to open up to her, a virtual stranger. I remember despite the first impression, trying to be vulnerable saying something like I use to be socially anxious I did the work and I am not anymore but I still struggle to connect with people even though I put in effort and am genuine and she said something weird like I have a control problem and that maybe I am being  fake and not genuine.


Third person I saw today for like an assesment for  conditions and treatment plans. Again she was late!!! I literally have to move my whole day around these appointments and have to wake early and just go in wait mode till these appointments for them to be late??? For the first meeting???? Anyway, she didn't introduce herself or anything. She just asked if I could hear her and asked why I'm here. Pretty vague. I explained what I've experienced then she got a questionnaire with 4 response options and we went through it and it was a 40 min meeting. She didn't ask about childhood experiences or ask any details when I explained I use to be depressed or anxious.  It was pretty surface level. She said nothing is wrong with me but still wanted to prescribe me welbutrin. She didn't even go over other treatment plans therapy wise. It was weird.

Anyway since that exprience I called some other places for appts and all the receptionists were so curt and rude when I ask simple questions like what insurance they take or the name of the provider. One receptionist wanted to schedule me but said he does not know the name of the provider when I asked and was rude about it like how dare I ask such a ""dumb"" question even though is it not normal to want to know the name of who you will be speaking with?


Like why has this been my experience? Is this normal??

Please wish me luck. I’m genuinely terrified. Even after the consultation I just felt very uneasy like I shared too much of myself too fast (even though I’m pretty sure that’s what therapy consists of lol).

One is calm and sweet, but the other is a terror—stealing tissues, climbing on my head, jumping on her desk, and twice now, humping my head (four times in the last session).

1jj9b3v,2025-03-25T08:07:36,At a crossroad.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. We've been married for 22 years, together for a lot longer than that with three kids, two in high school and one in college.

 I got a text from the sheriff's department asking me to call them and then a flood of texts from the neighbors asking me what was going on.  I knew my daughter was at home alone and feared the worst.  I spoke with the sheriff, and he said they were taking her to the emergency room, and I immediately left a meeting and met her there.  My wife was in-flight on her way to visit my mother-in-law, oldest daughter, and her sister who traveled out there with her.  She received the same texts from the neighbors and was frantic so I tried to keep her updated as best I could on the way to the ED.  After a long wait I was able to see her and thankfully she was fine physically but was referred to an inpatient mental health facility. 
 
I agreed and headed that way to fill out paperwork and get her checked in.  My wife wanted to fly back but I told her to stay out there as it was important to spend time with everybody (her Mom has serious health issues), that visiting hours were limited, and that I would take care of things at home.
I visited my daughter at every opportunity at the facility, dealt with the billing, paperwork, appointments and everything else while keeping my wife updated several times daily.  I reached out to my daughter’s boss, school, and her performance group to let them know she was hospitalized and keep them updated.

My wife was unsure about staying out there, but I assured her I had things under control and to spend quality time with the rest of the family, but I did warn her I would need time to decompress once she got back.
I adjusted my work schedule so I could drop off and pick up my son every day and spend as much time as possible with him between doctors’ appointments, visits with my daughter, and work.   We cooked dinners together, watched movies, and cleaned up the house so my wife and daughter would come home to comfort.

After about a week my daughter was discharged, and I brought her home.  My wife was flying back that night, so I got her car washed as she mentioned it being particularly dirty before she left.  We all went to pick her up at the airport and had an emotional reunion.  
We set up appointments for family and individual therapy and while there is still a long journey ahead, my daughter is headed in the right direction.  
I was supposed to go out of town for a boys’ weekend at a lake and while I felt it would be good for my mental health; I felt it best to stay home and spend time together as a family.  

Saturday morning, I woke up early to feed and let out the dog and noticed that she had gotten into the trash and spread it throughout the first floor of the house.  I cleaned it up, laid down on the couch to watch TV and dozed off.  I woke to my wife asking me if my son and I had spoken about quitting Muay Thai as we had missed it, it was expensive, and he had expressed to her he didn’t want to go any more (keep in mind we started going together at his request).  I was mildly annoyed as there was no hello or good morning, just pointed questions, but we agreed to cancel it going forward and I let it go.
Later we were all hanging out in the family room and she mentioned she had been looking at new light fixtures for the house.  I expressed surprise because we had been discussing getting a new dining room set and asked “I thought you wanted a new dining room set?”.  She said she wanted the dining set, the lights and a lot more.  For background, I handle our long-term finances, and she handles the short-term.  We have been discussing home upgrades for some time, but she felt we couldn’t afford them.  I told her let’s make a list and prioritize them.  I chose a new cooktop and hood as ours wasn’t working correctly which aggravated me daily as I do most of the cooking.  She wanted a new dining room set.  She didn’t think we could afford both and I told her we could tap into long term funds whether that was via loans or selling stock.  I moved forward on the cooktop and she was going to pick out and order the dining room set.  She wasn’t convinced we could afford what she wanted and pointed out that I was going on a snowboard trip that I had been planning for a year.  I told her I would skip the trip if that made her more comfortable ordering the dining room set she wanted.  I was willing to sacrifice something important to me for something important to her, so when she mentioned the lights and more I was thrown off because I had sacrificed something important to me and the dining room set didn’t seem important to her anymore, and I didn’t understand.  We discussed it further and while I didn’t raise my voice I am sure my aggravation and surprise came through.  She burst into tears and went upstairs.

She stayed in our room the rest of the day except for coming down briefly for dinner.  I tried to engage with her but she didn’t seem interested.  Later a neighbor invited us over to their house for drinks and board games but when I asked if she wanted to go she declined.  I ended up falling asleep early on the couch.  The next morning I received the following text – “I’m leaving for a little bit.  When I get back I think we need to have a discussion about our future.  This isn’t it”.

I immediately went to speak with her and she told me that she didn’t feel I support her and implied we should end things.  I told her my side of the story and then left to go for a drive to clear my head.  

I am not perfect by any means and have many things I could handle better, but I am a good father and husband.  I love my wife but feel like I am at my wit’s end.  I could not have been more supportive for everybody in my family during one of the worst periods in our lives and then to be told I am not being supportive and threatened with divorce is heartbreaking.  I told her I need time to decompress but felt attacked and then no concern for my feelings.

I know everyone is under stress and I am trying to give grace, but I need support, too.  The last time I needed support was when I was caring for my Mom full-time through a divorce complicated by dementia, which eventually led to an ALS diagnosis and eventually her passing all in the middle of Covid.  During this time my wife was cold, distant, and said “she needed some space”.  The two times that I truly needed support in our marriage not only did I not get it, but it felt like a heavier burden was placed on me.

We work well together as parents and have built a good life for ourselves financially, but I’ve felt for some time that I am putting more effort into us than she is.  Our plan was for the kids to graduate high school, we would retire early, and travel the world, but it’s tough to see now.

We’ve tried marriage counseling in the past and while I saw value in it, she didn’t and the last time I brought it up she said, “the counselor looked at me like I was crazy and that’s probably what you wanted”.  After a moment of stunned silence, I told her “no, I want you to be happy, I want us to be happy”.

My plan is to continue to focus on my daughter and the other kids to get us through this crisis but put less effort into the relationship.  I’ve come to the realization I can’t make her happy if she doesn’t put an effort into making herself happy.  While I hope for her and the kids’ sake she finds happiness, I suspect once I am removed from the situation, she’ll still be unhappy and realize what could’ve been.  It sucks that I can’t retire soon as planned and will have to start over again.  All I know is I can’t do this anymore.

We plan to continue family counseling, and I am considering individual counseling again despite my last counselor ghosting me.  I suspect it was because on the surface I would appear self-aware but I still felt value in expressing my feelings.

1jiji4i,2025-03-24T10:53:59,Why do I get attached so quickly?,"I’ve been noticing something about myself lately, and I’m trying to understand it better—why do I get attached so quickly? Not with everyone, but with certain people, it feels like I connect almost immediately. And then, when I don’t hear from them, I start wondering if I messed something up.

I’ve been thinking a lot about why this might be. Growing up, my dad wasn’t really emotionally available. He wasn’t cruel, but he just didn’t have the energy to show much interest in me. I remember, even at four years old, feeling like I was always chasing after him—trying to get his attention, trying to get him to see me.

I’m starting to wonder if that experience is tied to how I attach to people now. When someone shows interest or affection, it feels like a big deal to me—like it’s rare, and I need to hold onto it. I guess I learned early on that love and connection are things you have to pursue, not things that just come naturally.

It’s clear to me now that this isn’t the healthiest pattern. I’m aware of it and I’m working on it with therapy, which has been helping a lot. But I’m curious—has anyone else experienced something like this? How do you manage the anxious thoughts when they come up, like wondering if you’ve done something wrong just because someone hasn’t responded?

I want to find a balance where I can care deeply without feeling like I’m chasing or holding on too tight. Would love to hear any thoughts or strategies that have worked for you.

1jiaq67,2025-03-24T03:17:53,Update on the girl I've been hallucinating,"I made a post a little less than a month ago venting my frustration and fear at this hallucination I've been having. It's constant and at times unnerving. However, at the time I wrote that post I was feeling very trapped and hopeless, and since then I've tried to steady myself and stop trying to avoid Amarilli (the girl I see). I always try to remember that she is part of me and in no way a real entity, even if it's often hard to convince myself if it, given that I sense her in every possible way.

When I wrote the first post I felt like I'd ran out of ways to try and escape her, and to be fair I did. So I did the only thing I thought I could do and released a cry for help to people who don't know me. Now I'm trying a different approach, as stated. Keeping in mind that she's not real, I've been studying Amarilli. I tried to understand exactly how she works, how she interacts with the world and with me. And most important of all, I learned to control her a little bit.

I can make her stand still and walk around, and even disappear and reappear somewhere else. I cannot get rid of her, of course, but I can choose where to ""put"" her, so to speak. I also learned that she can interact with objects, but not people: if she moves a chair I'll see it move, even though it really doesn't, and then the chair will be back where it really is after I look away. If she touches a person, I will see her either stumble back or appear somewhere else, but other people are never affected by her. That's a big weight off my chest, because it means I can at least trust that what I see others doing is real. 

I also learned that I can trigger some types of sensation if I want, depending on how much I focus. If I touch her without thinking about it I will feel her like I would anybody else, but if I concentrate and tell myself she's not real I can phase through her, and she'll vanish and pop up in a different spot. If I think about her doing a certain thing for long enough, eventually she does it. That's how I get her to walk in the direction I want.

Having this kind of control over Amarilli makes her a lot less frightening. The worst thing she used to do was stand next to my bed and stare at me as I slept; now with a bit of effort I can get her to sit down and look away. Her smiles have started looking less taunting and more soft. I think I might be starting to enjoy her company a little bit. She gives me something to do by ""working"" on her whenever I'm bored, and she makes me feel like I'm never alone. Sure, at times this same feeling is very creepy, and I'd still like her to leave me be occasionally, but at this point I'm just curious as to what are the limits of our interactions. 

I'm trying to get her to speak now. She never spoke a word before, and I really wonder what kind of voice she had. My life isn't that great all things considered, but Amarilli is strangely turning from its very worst aspect to almost a positive inclusion. I hope I manage to keep her like this, or get rid of her for good.",therapy,made post little less month ago venting frustration fear hallucination ive constant times unnerving however time wrote post feeling trapped hopeless since ive tried steady stop trying avoid amarilli girl see always try remember part way real entity even often hard convince given sense every possible way wrote first post felt like id ran ways try escape fair thing thought could released cry help people dont know im trying different approach stated keeping mind shes real ive studying amarilli tried understand exactly works interacts world important learned control little bit make stand still walk around even disappear reappear somewhere else cannot get rid course choose put speak also learned interact objects people moves chair ill see move even though really doesnt chair back really look away touches person see either stumble back appear somewhere else people never affected thats big weight chest means least trust see others real also learned trigger types sensation want depending much focus touch without thinking feel like would anybody else concentrate tell shes real phase shell vanish pop different spot think certain thing long enough eventually thats get walk direction want kind control amarilli makes lot less frightening worst thing used stand next bed stare slept bit effort get sit look away smiles started looking less taunting soft think might starting enjoy company little bit gives something working whenever im bored makes feel like im never alone sure times feeling creepy id still like leave occasionally point im curious limits interactions im trying get speak never spoke word really wonder kind voice life isnt great things considered amarilli strangely turning worst aspect almost positive inclusion hope manage keep like get rid good,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jiaq67/update_on_the_girl_ive_been_hallucinating/,Neutral,Moderate Concern
1jhs76d,2025-03-23T10:58:19,My therapist walked out mid session,"Yesterday I finally decided to go to therapy after many people here told me I should get help. I wanted to address my rape fantasy and was hoping to fix it.

She also told me I should stay away from my girlfriend until I resolve this even though I already explained that I have never done anything to harm her or anyone in general.

This has left me feeling embarrassed with myself. Maybe this wasn’t the therapist’s intention, but I think the fantasy is gone. I don’t know how long it will last but hopefully forever.

1jhx9as,2025-03-23T17:04:30,I’ve never told my girlfriend the reason I stopped going to the gym is because I like it when other women look at me. I don’t know if I should tell her now.,"So I've been struggling in my relationship for a while. I've been seeing my therapist since about September, mainly because I have communication issues but now it feels amazing to be able to articulate my feelings out loud.

For the past year or two we've been having sexual incompatibility issues. Sometimes she says it's because she wonders if she's asexual, sometimes she says it's because I'm not attentive enough, one time she said she wasn't finishing, but I get a new answer every time I ask how to improve things. She says she wants consistency from me, says she feels like one day I'm going to wake up and just leave her and she's afraid that every day will be that day.

I've tried to remain consistent. I've tried working with her to accommodate her needs and feeling but I feel like it's never enough. When I try to remain consistent she says I'm love bombing her, when I stop trying she says it causes her to panic. She asks me to text her how I'm feeling but whenever I do it devolves into an argument where she's yelling and then either I shut down or she shuts down.

I just want to feel desires. I stopped going to the gym consistently because, while living at my previous building, I'd always see this girl walking her dog and checking me out. Normally I'd chalk it up to me just wilding, because who would want me(?), but as I've grown in my career and as a person I've learned a lot of women do want a guy like me. I'm actually desirable.

I stopped going because I felt like I wanted that at home, that if I worked with her and focused on us then I wouldn't need that kind of validation. My desire has only grown. I want to feel wanted. I want to feel loved. I want to come home to someone who still thinks I'm hot. 

We've talked and she says things are getting better but I'm becoming resentful because I don't see her changing at all. I've asked her to see a personal therapist and she's done virtually nothing on that end (but I forgive her because I think of how many years I fought off the idea too). We saw a couples therapist once but now she gets upset (body language wise) when I mention it again because the time we tried she said she hasn't had an orgasm with me and I shut down because I'd been begging her to tell me what was wrong and what she needed in our sex life. 

I feel like she hasn't forgiven me for it. I mean what was I even supposed to say? ""You faked it pretty well."", ""Why didn't you tell me that when I asked you time and time again what you need from me?"", ""Why am I just hearing this now?"", ""You won't even make yourself orgasm yet you expect me to do it?"", ""Maybe if you get your nose out of a book and actually try to HELP me then maybe just maybe we could solve this but you're so set on avoiding failure that you'd rather I look like an A-hole!"".

I've gained about 17 pounds since we met, technically it's healthy because I was underweight, but now I look at myself in the mirror and I think ""What if she doesn't want you because she's disgusted by you? What if it's the man boobs? The jelly rolls? The lack of abs?"" and I want to just cry sometimes. I want to try going back but I'm terrified I'll fall in love with the first person who looks at me with an ounce of desire.

I'm terrified that my coworker is right and I am actually attractive. I'm afraid that I'm right too. I'm afraid that if I get back down to my low weight she's going to want me again and if we do break up I'll never be able to get back to this point. I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm 25, unhappy and all I want is to be able to cry in her arms and tell her to help me! I want to tell her I'm struggling and that I don't want to marry her until she's worked on her sex drive or helped me understand her better or helped me figure out what she needs.

I want to tell her she's selfish for not getting help while knowing I'm struggling. I want to tell her that she's every bit as bad as she thinks she is because she's creating a self fulfilling prophecy. I want her to tell me that she's every bit doesn't want this anymore or get help or tell me what I can do to help her.

I can't marry her or rather I can but I know I can't have kids with her. It's bad now but I know that I'll collapse in on myself if we have kids and she uses them as an excuse to never have sex again. I say collapse because I know I won't cheat, I can't do it. It's not because I love her too much or because I'm selfless or cheating is wrong. I can't do it because it would break a part of me that I want to keep, a part of me that's a dreamer and believes in hope.

I can't tell if I'm venting or want advice anymore.

1jhis8u,2025-03-23T02:40:33,When to know it's time to switch Therapist?,"So for some context I've been doing therapy for around 5 months, this month marks as the fifth month.  I haven't done therapy before and my friend kept recommending me to try out therapy so I took the first step to do therapy.  I found a therapist that loves working with individuals that are highly sensitive and neurodivergent, so I thought to myself maybe this therapist might understand how I feel cause I fit that description.

  
So every session I feel it's been alright? Of course, there are still many times I feel uncomfortable about saying certain traumatic stuff in the past, but it's therapy, so sometimes we have to get uncomfortable to start the healing process.  Until recently just yesterday, my last session with my therapist.

  
We were touching on some topics about romantic relationships because what I seek as safe in a romantic partner cause the fear I have of my family from the past.  So I told my therapist that I have a tendency of seeking romantic partners who have the caring, nurturing aura who gives you affection and wants to protect you.  Like in the sense of if it were the dynamic of a relationship, it would be roles reversed. Where the guy is more like the feminine energy and the girl is the masculine energy kinda.  Something like the guy is the more feminine, submissive and shy guy and the girl is more the dominant, masculine, and caring nuturer kinda? 

  
I never tell this to anyone, other than my friends because they understand where I'm coming from and they've been in relationships where the roles were reversed and one of them is currently in one, so they know where I'm coming from.  So I thought since it's therapy maybe I can come out of my shell and feel a bit vulnerable and express my thoughts in terms of romantic relationships because therapy with my therapist slowly felt like a safe space I can be vulnerable about myself and I know most people might judge me cause the social norm doesn't accept that kind of relationship for the most part or might be look down upon. But I know it's possible because my friends and myself also has been in role reversed relationships in the past, all my relationships in the past were like that where I felt safe.

  
So after I told my therapist, she said ""Most women would find that very unappealing in their romantic partners."" and afterwards I told her I know that's the case, but there's a small minority of people who still fit that. It's not impossible where in a relationship, the roles are reversed, but the chances of it happening are just very small.  She gave me a weird face expression, like the face you give when you're in a kinda awkward situation and I felt judged when she did that. and after a minute of silence she told me that ""You're an adult, and you need to grow up and face reality."" and the second she said that I frozed and was like ???? Like I understand everyone has their own values and I respect that, but I thought my therapist would've been supportive and understanding of my values instead of shutting me down...? and I also felt in a sense she was projecting her own values onto me.  



Like I thought about from her viewpoint. Let's say okay I did actually did change my values in terms of my relationship, and faced reality.  Is that implying I have to become masculine and do what the social norm of is of becoming the man of the relationship.  But that's not me, that's essentially asking for me to change into a different person, change my personality. I'm a person who loves cute things and acts cute naturally, acts feminine, and acts as the little one in the relationship while still acting mature when needed in a relationship.  

  
So after she said ""You're an adult, and you need to grow up and face reality."" she went silent for an entire 3 minutes as it was getting to the end of our session and she ended it with ""Think about it before our next session."" I was like even more like ?????

  
Idk why, but in this session I felt hurt and invalidated...? Idk if I'm being the one who is overthinking because my own individuality hasn't grown to the degree where I have to accept reality that I no longer can act cute be the feminine person of the relationship or if my therapist was the one who went a bit too far.  and now I'm contemplating if I should discontinue my therapy session with this therapist and it's time to find another therapist.  I'm just kinda lost and I just needed some outside perspective.

The thing is, I don't understand why this keeps happening. I have a long history of trauma and low self-esteem. My job involves a toxic work environment (not from my boss or anything, but from people I work around). They say horrible things about me. 

I have been seeing a therapist for two years, and we meet weekly. Sometimes waiting a week for a session feels much longer, because so much happens within a week. I have a lot on my mind, constantly. My therapist is really good at listening and understanding my problems, and she would want me to call her if I'm thinking about relapsing. I have called her for that reason. 

The thing is, I continue to do things that aren't good for me. I drink too much and I want to cut. Most days, I don't eat enough. I count calories and push myself to perform the best I can (my job requires physical activity), in hopes that I lose more weight. I want to be so thin that there is no fat. My therapist has called me out on losing weight, and people at work have also commented on it. It just makes me want to lose more. I want to see bones. 

...if I had to guess, I want a sense of control over my body. I want to starve it and cut it as much as I want to. People keep advising me against it, but I still want to do it. What's wrong with me? Why do i always self-destruct?

I don’t know who i am going to get then, they would just give me who on the spot. Within the first 10 minutes, I already want to leave the session. Maybe because she wasn’t ‘getting’ my intrusive thoughts and how disturbing they were (hocd, harm). She keeps saying that these thoughts are outside of OCD and more of identity (i’m not triggered dw). I mentally checked out on what she was saying because I guess I knew that we were just incompatible psych-client. No disrespect tho, the psych center have credible psychologist/psychiatrists all with Masters/Doctorate degree. I’m quite disappointed or dissatisfied. Feel like I just wasted my money. She was more of like a school counselor. Head straight to “try to talk your feelings to others and get insights from them.” She says that the self-harm part was also because of identity. Girl??????? Clearly, you’re not an anxiety specialist and IT SHOWS.

In the end, i just selectively chose what i need to hear and thats ‘acceptance’ and ride the wave. Yes, i am disappointed about the session.

I suffer really bad with nostalgia depression. If you’re reading this you probably know what it is but for those who don’t… usually nostalgia is something nice and warm and “a trip down memory lane” but when I get it I feel awful, sad, useless, desperate to relive those days knowing that they are gone, and I feel this way from a few hours to sometimes a couple of days. It comes and goes in terms of how devastating it is but it’s always there sort of. When I hang out with my best mate, I spent so much time talking about our old college parties and feel terrible about it and sometimes (and this is the worst) I’ll create a group chat with all of our group from school / college and get ready to send them all a message). My life isn’t exactly bad now, in facts it’s pretty decent but I just feel awful about it. Im only 26 but I notice now that it starts effecting “in the now” moments; like I’ll be enjoying myself and think “I really need to enjoy this because I’ll look back at this moment in the future”. It’s hard to describe exactly. I guess I wanted to know how others deal with it? I don’t do therapy or anything like that and I’ve never been on medication for anything. Is there any good books or anything? What would you recommend because it’s really taking over me lately.

1jh99wo,2025-03-22T19:40:14,Friend broke my heart,"Hello everyone,
So I was getting real close with this person on Instagram who I didn’t even reach out to. She reached out to me. We hit it off real quick and became the best of friends. She always wanted to talk to me and she never missed a moment to talk to me. 

But then, she gets a boyfriend. He idolizes her all over his profile. Then reposts her pics without her knowledge or permission and blasts her all over his stories and posts like he just met an alien from a distant galaxy and won a huge prize. It was disgusting to say the least, especially since she’s only 14 and he’s almost an adult man. Ewww. He then boasts about how he’s gonna marry her and he literally just asked her to be his gf like a couple days prior.

When I first told her what he was doing, she was kind of uncomfortable with knowing he was doing that. I then warned her about the dangers of men his age in a loving and caring way. She was very grateful for the advice. We continue on as friends for about another week.

Then she starts changing. She slowly starts taking longer to reply, is not available as much, and is always on “active now” but never replies to me. She comes back with “so sorry! (Insert dumb excuse here) I’m going to bed now. Love you bestieeee!” Ok no big deal right?

Nope! The next morning I say “hello” she leaves me on “seen” and her profile disappears. It appears as tho she blocked me since you can find her profile on a web browser while being logged out. I tried texting her cell, no dice. I even called her but it went straight to voicemail. I guess she blocked me everywhere. 

But why!?! What the hell did I ever do to her! We were cool and we were inseparable. But I guess I was a fool for thinking that. Not only does she block me with no explanation, but she abandons me on the day I come down with a cold no less! Like WTF dude! This isn’t the first time this happens to me either. Seems like a pattern with people. They find a new partner, the friends all take a backseat. Especially the single ones. Ouch.

I’m tired of being treated like this. I get if someone needs space or a break but at least have the courtesy to tell me 5 words. I. Don’t. Want. To. Talk. Or even 3 like, Leave. Me. Alone. It hurts but at least I’ll respect that. But she didn’t even have the courtesy to do that. Why do people do this?!? Why would she break my heart like this after all the time we spent together?

Was she just using me to fill a void until she found a guy and I became an afterthought once he came? Or was he forcing her to stop talking to me because he got jealous of how much time I was spending with her. Cause that’s happened too.

Please folks, try to help me understand because I’m tired of this shit.

1jh97pp,2025-03-22T19:37:18,Help me help her,"
We (FF/49&45) have been together for 11 years, 8 of them married. We’ve been through lots of ups & downs life wise but never really relationship wise, we never had a reason to fight or argue, we calmly discussed our problems. We always got along wonderfully, we never stopped going on dates, writing each other sweet notes, chores are ~50/50 depending on who has more time & energy. 
About a 1 ago we started arguing every now & then but it resolved quickly until the arguments repeated again & again,we never really resolved the cause.. mostly issues with jealousy, being afraid I’ll leave her for someone else. Starting with her suddenly getting jealous & seeing everyone I’m close with as trying to get between us, no reason behind it apparently, on the way to a dinner party we argued & when we arrived I went to another friend & left her to go alone, I realize I should’ve handled this more calmly & I apologized for getting louder & leaving, since then it’s not really the same anymore, I don’t know if she got scared or anything, she knows Im not violent, I didn’t scream at her, I know she hates that, but I think she sees small issues as an argument already& getting upset as getting angry.  

She has a history of abusive relationships,went no contact with most family, she was diagnosed with cptsd/gad, battled addiction , suicidal thoughts,all before we met. It was never a problem for our relationship in my eyes, she was always more or less worried it would affect our relationship. Jealousy might have something to do w/ her body dismorphia which I think has been around since the jealousy started. She jumped from one diet to another from time to time. 
When I ask her what’s wrong she either says nothing’ ‘I’m just not feeling well’ ‘I don’t wanna talk about it’ when I ask her friends they say they don’t know, maybe a depressive episode which has happened in the past: she stopped talking to me told me it’s nothing, until a nervous breakdown, I supported her through therapy and everything seemed to be going well, after that we got married, bout two years in a similar episode, but resolved quickly. 

We barely talk sometimes, if we do we argue. Few days we actually act like a couple, I try not to ruin those moments by not mentioning anything about these issues.
I usually do her hair/nails, she asks me to do it, we make put a time, but then tells me she doesn’t feel like it anymore, I make breakfast, plan dates, try to talk to her, nothing from her side, she barely eats some days, she goes to bed at 7pm sometimes and spending much more time in bed.. I have no idea how to save our relationship. I think she thinks  I already decided for myself I’m gonna divorce anyway & there’s no point in doing anything about it. I’m willing to go to any therapy she wants, I suggested couples therapy she said ‘you don’t believe in that anyway’ I said that in the very beginning to a friend, idk how she even remembers that. She said ‘you’ll leave me anyways’ 

When I asked her best friend she said ‘maybe a depressive episode, please stay with her’  (To her friends she seems quite normal, despite being more depressed, she talks to them laughs w/ them, they go out together. ) What if it’s worse than that, last time it was her mom passing away, I would know if someone else passed away, what if it’s a bad diagnosis? Or hers?

It bothered her that I work longer or stay in the car for a while, when she told me that I came home early the whole week but we barely talked & spend the rest of the day in different rooms, following week I worked longer again she complained I don’t wanna come home to her, I told her whats the point if she ignores me, she said nothing & left. Half my friends are apparently flirting with me and wanting to date me, one she even titled as a competition to her. 

For everyone suspecting she cheated, I’d put my hand in fire, she’s the most loyal person I know.   I want to help her but I can’t if she doesn’t want any help or can’t even tell me what’s wrong..
How do I talk to her..

Sorry for the long read, Tried to make it as short as possible,

1jgcokr,2025-03-21T14:45:56,What is acceptance supposed to feel like ? Does it mean being apathetic to the situation? And not caring?,"Hi all , 

What is acceptance supposed to feel like ? Does it mean being apathetic to the situation? And not caring? 

I think not caring about anything easier but I just can’t do it . I care a lot. Maybe too much ? Is there a thing as caring too much ? 

Is acceptance something you force or choose or something that just happens? 

For example right now : current workplace has poor ergonomics which is triggering / worsening my pain and tension. It’s very hard to change it and it’s making me so frustrated and angry. 

I know what will make it better but I can’t execute the modifications.  

I’m doing things to make it feel better at home but I can’t help think if I go back to work everyday and just trigger my symptoms again I think I’m derailing my progress. Then the efforts feel like a waste , I’m just maintaining it from getting worse , not better. And I do feel the bad effects compounding. 

It would be easier to accept it but does that mean I just give up for sometime? because I just accept how bad it is and leave it be? 

Accepting is easier , my brain can stop needing to find solution and thinking but means I won’t do anything to make it better, and will get worse because I ignore. 

Also I find myself feeling really trapped and frustrated all the time with things that aren’t easily solved . Which also means it gets in the way of me doing the right things. With a lot of resentment and anger. 

Does that feeling conditional  and only go away or only until it gets resolved ?",MentalHealthSupport,hi acceptance supposed feel like mean apathetic situation caring think caring anything easier cant care lot maybe much thing caring much acceptance something force choose something happens example right current workplace poor ergonomics triggering worsening pain tension hard change making frustrated angry know make better cant execute modifications im things make feel better home cant help think go back work everyday trigger symptoms think im derailing progress efforts feel like waste im maintaining getting worse better feel bad effects compounding would easier accept mean give sometime accept bad leave accepting easier brain stop needing find solution thinking means wont anything make better get worse ignore also find feeling really trapped frustrated time things arent easily solved also means gets way right things lot resentment anger feeling conditional go away gets resolved,5,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jgcokr/what_is_acceptance_supposed_to_feel_like_does_it/,Negative,High Risk

15dp3bq,2023-07-30T21:30:49,NAVIGATING COVID19_SUPPORT,"**\[Last updated 30 July 2023\]**

It's been nearly three-and-a-half years since this sub was recreated (on 12 Feb 2020) with the intention of it being a place where people could come for advice and reassurance about the (then not quite officially but clearly heading in that direction) COVID19 pandemic – an alternative to sensational media stories and difficult-to-interpret-unless-you're-an-expert scientific papers. 

It sprang out of a recognition that, on other COVID19 subs, people were asking questions they wanted answered, but that those subs did not want to set themselves up to answer. A space was needed where self-posts were welcomed and responded to. 

A lot has changed since then. Mostly – and this is extremely important for how this sub operates –COVID19 has come, has been conquered (by vaccination, by evolution of less serious strains, by herd immunity that, going forward, will be embedded in childhood) and has largely gone. It's over, and we're out the other side. 

For the vast, vast majority of people, life today doesn't – and doesn't need to – look significantly different to how it did in 2019. And if it does for you, because you have serious underlying health conditions or because you don't want things to go back to normal, this is not the place for you. If you fall into the former category, you need qualified medical professionals' advice on how to navigate the residual risks of the pandemic; and if you're in the latter category, you need qualified medical professionals' advice on how to get past this. No-one here is qualified to give you either.

This is the place for you if you want it to go back to normal but are struggling to get there (users here are great for explaining how they have coped, and offering suggestions, or helping you to realise that even if you've had a really tought three years, it won't always be like this); if you have family members who are significantly more or less cautious than you and want help and suggesions with how to deal with them (which may be that they're right and you're ... less right, and you would may be best giving them some leeway); and if – as was initially intended – you need help understanding something in the media or a scientific journal that's not entirely clear. That last one is pretty much the only one I wanted to be answering when I started this sub but the rest of you had other ideas. I rolled with it, mostly. But I drew the line at things I didn't think were helpful, such as validating extreme behaviours. I will continue to do so. 

The sub is much quieter these days than it used to be - which is absolutely the way it should be. People largely no longer need advice about to deal with the pandemic because it's pretty much over. We're out the other side. 

**For those of you who do still find your way here** \- please take note of what's written above. This isn't the place for people who don't want to ever go into a crowded bar again, or think air travel is death sentence, or aren't ever going to send their kids to in-person school. There are places on reddit to connect with people who think like that; personally I think they're as dangerous as the subs that, in mid-2020, were calling for no restrictions at all, and which tell you vaccination will cause cancer and kill you, but unlike those sub they're not a danger to society so if that's where you want to be, it's ultimately up to you - please go there. But please leave my sub alone.

Throughout the pandemic, we have walked (hopefully successfully) a fine line between making reasonable adjustments to behaviour where they're justified, and calling them out where they're not - e.g. in April 2020, keep your distance in a supermarket or the street, but don't bleach your groceries. In April 2023, enjoy your graduation ceremony/cousin's wedding/Taylor Swift concert. Times change. Holding the middle ground hasn't always made us popular (with lockdown skeptics or those who don't want lockdown to ever end) but popularity isn't everything: accuracy and facts are. 

So, here we are, close enough to the end that it was time to replace a sticky that was out of date. Some of the rules/info below needed a refresh, some didn't, but it was time to update. 

Thanks to those of you who've stuck with us, all the best to those who've drifted away, and I sincerely hope we never, ever, have to do this again.

1frqlkl,2024-09-29T04:35:44,Health anxiety and doomerism about covid's long-term effects,"So I'm somebody who has suffered from pretty severe health anxiety my entire life, trigger warning for anyone of a similar persuasion. I've just got over my second covid infection (it was a bit worse than my first in 2022 but nothing too awful) which hit me by surprise after having largely forgotten covid - I'd been triple-vaxed in 2021, figured after an infection I'd have good immunity, and have been worried more about other health issues in the mean time...

I made the mistake of googling what reinfection could mean and found very scary articles implying it could lead to all sorts of health complications, do ""cumulative damage"" to just about every organ, etc. This really shocked me, the prevailing message here at the moment is that covid is just another virus, people without major risk factors don't have much to worry about (boosters and antivirals aren't being offered outside of high-risk groups). But now I'm finding people (on certain covid-cautious subreddits for example) expressing very doom-y opinions (that societies will all be gradually disabled by long covid, that it will lead to a horrendous epidemic of heart attacks/strokes/diabetes/dementia/Parkinson's/etc./etc. in previously healthy people...).

This is all a massive trigger for my anxiety, led to me having panic attacks during my infection which was not very helpful, and now even though I've recovered I don't know how I can feel safe. How can I stop worrying about the ""silent damage"" it might have done to me (or my 75yo dad who caught it at the same time)? Can we do anything to prevent these complications? Am I screwed already because I've had it twice? What about when I inevitably get it a third time?

1f8kgp1,2024-09-04T09:52:30,Persistent Sore Throat/Hoarseness Post-COVID: Seeking Advice and Shared Experiences,"Hello everyone, I am a healthy and active 25 year old male.

I've been dealing with a persistent sore throat since recovering from COVID-19, and I'm reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced something similar or has any advice. Here's a bit more about my situation:

* I contracted COVID-19 about six months ago. Since then, I've had a lingering sore throat that hasn't completely gone away.
* The soreness for the most part, is relatively mild (about 2.5-4/10 on the pain scale), but it's constant and tends to get worse when I'm stressed or have to use my voice extensively.
* I train regularly, eat a healthy diet, and my recent blood work came back perfect—no signs of ongoing inflammation or other issues.
* I have tried many things including every nutraceutical you can name, antibiotics, rest, elimination diets etc,.
* 4 GPs, 1 ENT later and apparently this is is novel and uncommon to the point they don't really have a clue, which is frustrating obviously.
* The sore throat is more noticeable from mid-morning when I start having to use my voice for my job, to early afternoon. Also when I wake up. It somewhat improves after I eat and usually feels better after physical activity.
* My voice often feels hoarse, and speaking loudly or for long periods can exacerbate the soreness.
* An ENT has examined me and noted minimal inflammation. The diagnosis was possibly Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR), but treatments like omeprazole and Gaviscon haven't made a difference. I am a dietitian and have never had reflux issues. My diet has not changed post covid. I know this because I track EVERYTHING.
* Has anyone else dealt with lingering throat issues post-COVID?
* Have you recovered and if so how long did it take more or less?
* Are there any treatments or home remedies that you found helpful for similar symptoms?
* Could this be an autoimmune response or perhaps related to a different underlying condition that was overlooked?
* My theory is post viral inflammation, MAST cell activation, an overactive immune response, a new allergy brought on by covid or nerve damage?

1elxbzt,2024-08-07T05:30:02,"Support to adjust mindset and societal ""reintegration""","My baby was born in between Delta and Omicron. For various reasons I won't go into here, we isolated stringently for a long time after his birth. My husband and I still mask in public, and until very recently, we still masked when visiting one set of my child's grandparents. 

Due to the isolation measures, my son (now aged 2.5) doesn't do well socially. He's gotten better with adults but not other kids. He has only had a handful of play dates so far and doesn't attend daycare. He's a naturally a more reserved child, which, combined with lack of exposure, has led him to either fear or be disinterested in other children. For his sake, I know we have to let him have play dates, visit playgrounds and just interact with kids in general. He needs to go to school in a couple of years. However, all this makes me super anxious.

It seems the majority of society has returned to normal, treating Covid as a thing of the past, and I understand this isn't something we can control. I acknowledge there are lots of other harmful viruses and bacterial infections out there to worry about, some probably worse than Covid, so we have to balance concern/avoidance with practicality. We will have family visiting soon from abroad who want to meet up, and I am terrified at the idea of exposure through international travel...but maybe I'm being extreme in my concerns as no one else seems to bat an eye at this.

For anyone who is/has been in a similar situation, can you share your thoughts, recommendations or suggestions on this topic?  I'm asking with genuine curiousity and with the intention of learning! I've tried asking a few people I know who lived more conservatively/abided by restrictions more closely how they made the decision to relax (stop masking, socialize freely/normally) and feel comfortable with the new approach, and I got two categories of responses. One camp gave vague answers along the lines of everyone's doing it/it's too exhausting or impractical to live that way anymore - this is all logic that I get, but isn't helpful toward helping me adjust my mindset. The other camp reacted sensitively, which made me think they actually aren't confident in their choice, thought I was judging them and reacted negatively (evasive, aggressive, snarky responses) as a result.

1drv20a,2024-06-30T11:49:14,Health anxiety after First COVID-19 Infection,"Looking for support: I'm really struggling with health anxiety after getting my first ever COVID infection this month. 

I have POTS and before my COVID infection, I had been working with my care team to start working out and being active again after a heart surgery. I looked on Reddit to get an idea of when people started working out after COVID and it sent me into a major doom spiral. I kept reading about how people would return to exercise and suddenly develop long COVID, have heart attacks out of the blue, and other major complications, and it makes me so scared to do anything. 

Because of my POTS, I had to give up long distance running, and it was devastating. I started playing pickleball and weightlifting as a replacement and both make me so happy. I don't want to go through the trauma of losing another form of exercise I really love and that improve my mental health in less than a year. 

I know people totally have a right to share their experiences and some of those experiences have been helpful to read, but all I do now is read these posts and think about how that technically *could* happen to me too. Any time I have chest pain from my POTS, which is a common symptom, I think it's myocarditis. I keep thinking about how any workout I want to do, could be the one that makes me permanently sick. 

I'm in therapy and I plan to discuss this with my therapist when I see them next, and I plan on discussing this with my care team as well.

I gave birth in the ICU in winter 2020 after getting severe covid and my o2 dropping to the 80s. 

I ended up getting severely depressed within 6 months postpartum and gaining nearly 100lbs. I've been desperately trying to lose the weight on my own but I've just felt like I've been sucked into quick sand and can't seem to get myself out.
 
I function and take care of my 2 kids, they're healthy, happy and in sports. I keep on top of house work well enough and even managed to open and operate a hobby business while running the house. But I beat myself up pretty horribly every night and I physically feel like a completely different human than before covid. 

All family I am around got pretty heavy into the conspiracy stuff and called covid ""just a cold"" even after my experience so it's all felt pretty lonely going through the aftermath of my experience. Sort of like being gaslit through a pretty substantial traumatic experience.

1949dkz,2024-01-12T00:27:21,Post-covid cough at night?,"Hi guys, I just had covid for the first time in my life, I’ve been vaccinated with Pfizer x2. I (F22) would say I’m pretty young and healthy and active, I do suffer from some sinus issues due to my nasal anatomy which I was working with an ENT to get fixed, I always get sinusitis after any illness I get even if it’s a mild cold, and I did have some asthma issues as a kid which were mainly resolved and I have mild environmental allergies, nothing too crazy.

I started experiencing some symptoms on January 1 starting with a sore throat, I had two back to back cases of tonsillitis in November and it felt really similar, didn’t think much of it but also didn’t do much during that time. Sore throat started going down around January 3, but was then replaced with sinus pressure and fatigue along with an annoying cough and runny nose. Finally went to urgent care on January 5 in which I was told I was positive for Covid.

During that time I phased in and out of symptoms, lost my smell and taste, it came back then went away (still hasn’t come back). Had some fatigue, a cough, headaches and earaches. Doctor prescribed me bromphen-pse-dm, helped with all symptoms except the cough. Took Mucinex DM, was prescribed benzonatate, nothing has helped with the cough. Started on some antibiotics January 8 (amoxillen) to treat my sinus infection, it’s been clearing out and I feel pretty okay about it now, still taking the antibiotics. Tested negative January 9, and then tested negative again today January 11. 

However, the night of January 10 I’ve developed a very annoying uncontrollable cough that specifically only happens at night. At around 10am my breathing becomes sensitive, if I breathe too wrong and too hard I’ll start coughing. However, once I lay down in bed, it’s uncontrollable coughing from there. It won’t stop no matter how hard I try, I end up having to go to the kitchen, take some special honey and spend 30 minutes in a personal warm mist humidifier. It usually helps enough for me to fall back asleep, but then a couple of hours I wake up later with the same cough. Last night, I took the honey and did the humidifier before the coughing fit started, it worked and I feel asleep but woke up at 4am with the same thing. 

I’m not sure what to do, no cough medicine I’ve taken seem to help it at all, some of the solutions I have are only temporary, I’ve gone to the urgent care twice and they’ve prescribed two different things and they don’t seem to help the night cough.

I am scared and doctors told me it is not long covid, Today was a good day for me as i sat on my computer for 4 hours doing what i always do Playing games, and talking to my girlfriend, But while i was doing so, the first two hours it wasnt too bad, but after my insane muscle pain in my back, and arm started going crazy, I am scared that it is long covid or what could it be as i test negative?, I went to the doctors at the 23th of december and the 26th, As i have anxiety and its making me feel like living in hell not getting answers or an date on which i will be good again.  
  
My cough has getting better as a few days ago it was insane every time i ate, it is still a living nightmare w my cough but it has gotten somewhat better.

Congestion,
Coughing,

Fever 102, and

I'm 33 with no previous heart problems. My normal resting heart rate hovers around 70. I'm so scared and have read so many horrible things about heart damage, long covid, etc. 

I started Paxlovid yesterday and this morning have woken up with no fever and my heart rate is down to normal. 

Will it stay normal when Paxlovid is done? Or does the medicine just suppress it? Is it a good sign that it's normal after starting the med?

Can I get some comforting stuff like ""You're going to be fine"" and ""Your heart rate problems will resolve soon after you're well""? 

All the information I can find about covid and your heart says it will destroy me and stay messed up for months, and that I'm going to have weird symptoms forever and other catastrophic things. My doctor wasn't comforting when I asked him... He just said ""That can happen but you're young"". 

I should also mention I had 4 shots but haven't been boosted since early 2022. 

I need to know that once it's over, I'm not going to be finding out it did something horrible to me...

My mom is definitely in the high-risk category. She also has major anxiety and has basically avoided all interaction with others since 2020. She works from home and does all of her shopping through curbside.

This has been a point of contention with my sister, who has two young kids that are frequently sick. My sister gets mad at me and tells me my mom is being extreme - all because my sister wants my mom to come over and hang out with her and her kids. I try to explain to my sister that my mom is just scared, but whenever I do that I get called an enabler. She won't say anything to my mom about it, just me, because she knows my mom will shut her down. As an aside, they have always had a contentious relationship and my mom didn't speak with my sister for 5 years before covid started.

With that being said, I have no idea what level of caution to be living at. I keep seeing covid-doomer posts on twitter, and as someone with anxiety, it really is distorting my perception of what is/isn't safe regarding covid.

While I've been resting, I've been doing research on ways I can reduce my chances for long covid and any other complications.

I just don't understand how people can act like this is our new normal, and we just have to accept it. Our ""leaders"" are acting like nothing is happening while thousands of people are getting sick, permanently disabled, or dying. I'm so frustrated about how people are minimizing this as well.

179o28l,2023-10-17T08:09:57,Returning Taste and Smell? Please help :'(,"Hi everybody,

After 3 years, I unfortunately contracted COVID-19 earlier this month. This is a first-time infection for my family and I. I started to develop an itchy throat on the 3rd, and when I had tested with the rapid antigen test, I was negative until October 4th in the evening, where a faint line was seen.

The first few days after testing positive, I was still tasting and smelling things okay despite having less of an appetite. It wasn't until \~October 6th - 7th that while brushing my teeth, I wasn't really able to taste my toothpaste, even though I could feel the sting of it if that makes sense. I didn't lose my taste and smell completely - gradually, I was able to smell more of my candles, hand/body soaps, 70% isopropyl alcohol, and deodorant. I'm also able to taste sweet and salty things, but these flavours are quite muted.

Fast forward to now, which would make it either Day 12 or 13 (?If anybody could clarify, that would be great). I was able to smell fish cakes yesterday and take in a really flavorful soup. I even smelt my mom's coffee, but I had to really bring it up to my nose to take it in and it smelt like normal coffee (Again, no distortions).

I was kind of disappointed today, because my senses seemed to come and go throughout today - I was able to taste my lunch (again, muted flavors), and smelt my friends' lunch which was a very pungent smell of onion. I had shepherd's pie tonight, and was able to smell/taste the baked cheese and hot sauce that I put on, but again, dampened flavors (I've heard anecdotes that spicy food can help bring it back).

I'm very grateful that I don't have any more severe symptoms, albeit malaise and tiredness from recovery - I just wanted to ask about other people's timelines as to when their smells and tastes had returned 100%. Not gonna lie, I'm really just bummed out from having to taste super bland food because food provides me with a lot of comfort.

Thanks in advance, and hope you guys are taking care too!  


**EDIT:**  Wanted to post an edit since many people have commented since my write-up!

My taste and smell came back at around the 2.5 week mark after contracting COVID. Things started to smell and taste better around the 20th and it fully came back by the 21st and 22nd. It was still about 16 - 17 days for me. To assist with recovery, I did smell tests for strongly scented items every morning and night (Cinnamon, coffee, lemons, kimchi). I ate incredibly spicy food for many days due to an anecdote from a coworker about her dad getting her taste back very soon. I also took Vitamin C tablets religiously, and used saline nasal rinse to rinse out my nose 3 times a day.

Now, about 5 months later, all my smell and taste are back to normal. I sincerely hope that you guys recover soon, stay healthy and take care. :)

16z5acp,2023-10-04T03:44:15,Severe sore throat day 6,"Hey guys,

I first got covid sept 26. Started with a real hot fever and cold symptoms. Day 3 the scratchy throat turned into a fully enflamed throat and the area around where food and water comes from throat to my stomach is on fire and it burns every time I drink or eat.

I went to a clinic, they prescribed me one thing, Paxlovid. Now I've taken it for 3 days and I don't know if this person was thinking clearly. They prescribed no pain medication, nothing for my throat or lungs and I asked for help sleeping, nothing.

paxlovid are fairly large pills, you take 3 twice a day total of 6! So I told this doctor that I could hardly swallow and she just gives me giant pills to take? I told her I was in severe throat pain.

So every day I have to take 6 big paxlovid pills in two doses. Then I typically need 4-6 acetemetephin or ibuprofin to make it through the day pain wise.

Yet, every time I swallow I'm in agony so my day consists of trying to get my stomach balanced. Oh yea and then I just feel extremely nausea. The paxolvid makes me feel so weird and on edge. I couldn't get much drink or food down last night. I ended up sitting with my head in my hands at this desk. I managed to hold off the vommiting but it was bad. Then this morning I barely had any pee and it was darker you know when you haven't had enough water.

Figured I would get this out there and see if anyone has had similar situations with covid and paxlovid cause I dunno if it's good for me to take it anymore.

Edit: I created antibodies for Covid 19 and am no longer sick. I actually stopped taking paxlovid on day 3.5. I had felt absolutely horrible since I started taking it. My senses were heightened, my stomach was constantly bothered, the malaise was BAD. My heartrate, everything just felt wack. I told my wife and we decided it just wasn't good at all for me. Literally the next day, all of my symptoms were near gone. It was making me sicker than covid. So, I wouldn't recommend paxlovid unless you have a really bad immune issue or previous complications. I would have been 10x better just getting throat and cold meds. Literally felt like they poisoned me. I also got charged $328 for a throat swab, covid test and a prescription to Paxlovid. When I specifically asked for meds to help with my throat and sleep. I think they prescribed Paxlovid to me because I vaped? Personally I think it was a quick $ for them. So be careful folks, make sure you trust people before accepting experimental medications. Cause this nurse/doctor totally screwed me up.

I had a case of COVID this last September that was fairly typical— even exceptionally mild. Symptoms were minimal thanks to an early intervention with Paxlovid, and aside from some mild early muscle aches and heightened anxiety, things mostly resolved cleanly. I got some mild sinus symptoms after the Paxlovid ended, which cleared up last week (due in part to methylprednisolone that was prescribed to deal with the inflammation). The telltale fatigue that comes with the current variants even faded quickly. 

I thought I was mostly in the clear, but on Saturday what would have been about Day 20, I developed some mild weakness in both legs. Into Sunday, it turned into pain. That pain is now holding steady, though it improved to some degree earlier. 

I can’t stop having panic attacks, though, thinking this is it for me. This isn’t going to get better, or it’s going to progress to full blown CFS-type LC, even though I don’t have any of the fatigue at present.

16ua3l8,2023-09-28T13:42:57,In a COVID Doom Spiral,"Hey all, 29F here.

So up until recently I had been pretty good with “getting back to normal” I got the J&J vaccine, two Moderna booster shots and then got hit with Covid once at the beginning of this year. Was the absolute most productive cough of my life but that was pretty much the only symptom I had, on the whole I got through it well.

Recently I had a period of a few weeks of continuous social distress and upset, culminating in a friend almost taking his own life. Thank fuck he didn’t but something about what happened that day sent me into a really bad anxiety spiral. I started getting really bad physical symptoms including chest and arm pains - some of these led to panic attacks so bad I thought I was going to die and needed medical attention. Around this same time - stuff started popping up on my twitter timeline around how Omicron isn’t mild and Covid generally causes untold silent devastation on all your organ systems over time. The same accounts talking about these studies also talk about how everyone is living in denial about the severity of Covid because it’s more comfortable than the truth, that we’re upholding a collective delusion. That framing has absolutely destroyed my ability to look away and now whenever I try and look to sources of support to deal with this anxiety, or look at studies to the contrary of the doom mongers, there’s a voice in the back of my head telling me that I’m burying my head in the sand and that I’m biased, or too weak to face reality to protect myself from trauma. I have no idea how to break out of this cycle and all it’s done is make the anxiety and physical symptoms of it worse, it’s been completely ruining my life :(

If any of you have been in a similar period before, how did you cope/manage with it? I know some of this is tied to general anxiety issues and isn’t just strictly Covid related, but this is my biggest fixation right now and I have no idea what to do.",COVID19_support,hey f recently pretty good getting back normal got jj vaccine two moderna booster shots got hit covid beginning year absolute productive cough life pretty much symptom whole got well recently period weeks continuous social distress upset culminating friend almost taking life thank fuck didnt something happened day sent really bad anxiety spiral started getting really bad physical symptoms including chest arm pains led panic attacks bad thought going die needed medical attention around time stuff started popping twitter timeline around omicron isnt mild covid generally causes untold silent devastation organ systems time accounts talking studies also talk everyone living denial severity covid comfortable truth upholding collective delusion framing absolutely destroyed ability look away whenever try look sources support deal anxiety look studies contrary doom mongers theres voice back head telling im burying head sand im biased weak face reality protect trauma idea break cycle done make anxiety physical symptoms worse completely ruining life similar period copemanage know tied general anxiety issues isnt strictly covid related biggest fixation right idea,14,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/16ua3l8/in_a_covid_doom_spiral/,Neutral,High Risk
16tqesw,2023-09-27T22:47:18,Second time with Covid,"This is my second time and it's thankfully (so far) nowhere near as bad as the first time last year (I hit the one year mark in August) but I'm fully vaccinated (3 shots including bivalent) now (cosmic irony was I was about to get the updated shot this week). 

My family has all tested negative but about 8  days ago my siblings all had cold symptoms. Only one tested maybe 2-3 days in and it was negative. My dad came home Thurs-Friday coughing extremely bad and I was only around him for maybe a few minutes unmasked, he never tested since he thought it was allergies but the whole family was around him. 

I hardly go out of the house and wear a mask (KN95) literally everywhere. If it's not from family I have no idea where I got it. 

I started having symptoms around Sunday night (congestion, worst sore throat, headache and wicked anxiety) and Monday I could hardly swallow and had wicked body aches similar but less severe compared to the first time, drank a lot of soup, tea and water and felt better on Tuesday. I hardly had any symptoms but later in the day I started to get a cough. 

For laughs I tried a Covid test around midnight and it came up positive. Got extremely nauseous and felt like I was on a Tilt-a-Whirl but I assumed it was mostly anxiety since I've been dreading it and I'm also having an extremely heavy period. Didn't sleep well and now again to make sure I tested twice with different kits and I'm still positive. 

I still mostly just have a bad, mostly dry cough, that's like a tickle. I have an ache in my left side that I woke up with but honestly if I didn't do a test (and part of me wishes I didn't) then I would think I just have a really bad cold. 

What exactly is my timeline and how concerned should I be? I'm overweight, have an autoimmune disorder and possibly asthma but otherwise healthy. I'm not spiraling this time but I can't help but to be really anxious about LC and now I woke up with my left side ribcage hurting (assuming from coughing, I can breathe in okay but there's pressure there).

The sore throat was unbearable, as if I had blades attached inside my throat and every time i would swallow they would cut my throat. I am someone who gets sick at least once a year, just like the average person. But never in my life have i experienced such painful sore throat that I could not sleep because of the pain unless I was so tired I'd sleep for just 2 hours and then my body would wake me whenever i swallowed asleep because it was so painful.   


I went to the doc on the second day and she prescribed me Cefaclor (antibiotic), ibuprofen for fever and temperature and a throat spray. Ibuprofen really did help me with feeling better, my temp would go away and I would feel more energetic. And it lasted almost 8 hours until I would take the next dose. As for the antibiotic, it made me feel fatigue a little but that's a common side effect of these types of antibiotics.   


But the throat pain, no matter how many throat candies i took, honey, hot tea, and throat spray. It wouldn't get better at all. It was hell itself. I've probably had strep throat before when I was a kid but I don't really remember being so painful and so intolerable. This lasted for 4 whole days, and no signs of getting better at all. It was pure pain non stop. Then at the 5th day, the sore throat got slightly better. Fever was almost completely gone but the sore throat just gotten a little better. Then it kept getting better.   
I did not get tested for COVID however many rumours and news have been saying that a new variant of COVID is spreading which is making me wonder if that was actually COVID i've had or just some seasonal flu.

167lt23,2023-09-02T04:24:58,Terrified of catching covid a third time...,"Hey!

I had Covid twice last year, and it was mostly like a really bad flu for me, but it basically made my mental health issues 1000x worse. Ever since then, I am really scared about catching Covid again but I didn't let it stop me from doing things I need to do like going to uni, or having fun like going to a concert and whatnot.

Right now, though, my anxiety has sparked up a lot more about it. I see people coughing everywhere, but more importantly, I had a massage today and I've noticed during the massage that the lady that was massaging me sounded really sick. She was talking with a very heavy breath and was breathing heavily the whole time, really. I've had a massage from her before and she didn't sound like that, so I presume she must've been sick... and now I am -really- really scared about catching Covid again. I immediately disinfected my hands at the massage place still, then at home I immediately did again, and I took a shower (although I doubt that last bit helps...) 

Since that massage, I've been feeling like I have a tingle in my throat and I've been coughing slightly, but I know that's most likely just my anxiety giving me false symptoms since I am hyperfocusing on it... After all Covid doesn't show symptoms that fast (as far as I know...)

I just need some reassurance, and maybe some advice on how to calm down my anxiety regarding it-.. and if I do have it again, how to not panic about it...

1622yz0,2023-08-27T00:09:15,Should we cancel our vacation now?,"So my family has been very Covid-conscious these last 3 years.  We work from home, our son does online school, which hasn't been great for him, to be honest.  We've gone nowhere except on walks, we get everything delivered.  So it's been super low-risk.  But to say I'm okay mentally with this isolation would be a grave understatement.

My parents have been wanting to take my 10-year-old to Disney, and so they scheduled a trip for early October.  I should mention that we live across the country from them and I haven't seen them in over 5 years.  So we would have to take two flights to them, and then flying again together to Florida, and back.  

So not only are we flying all day, but then we're visiting a crowded park and basically going from almost no-risk to what I feel is Covid risk ultra. 

 I should mention that my 80-year-old dad had Covid last October and was fine, and my mom didn't do anything special to avoid him and apparently didn't get it.  They're also up-to-date on every shot for their age group.  

I was actually starting to be okay with going, but then this new variant popped up and I almost want to just cancel the whole trip.   But my parents are paying for this expensive vacation and it's been so long since I've seen them.  

But on the other hand, what if we go and get sick, and it's ruined anyway.  It just seems inevitable someone will get Covid.

I've had 2 shots and one booster, back in Jan. 2022. I know there's another updated booster coming but there's a chance it won't be available before I leave on Oct. 3.  Obviously I plan to mask in airports and on the plane, but I'm just worried that I'm making a mistake if I go that could have consequences down the line, i.e. long Covid.
I'm 45 and a little overweight but I'm never really had health issues, so maybe my anxiety is getting the best of me.

I know I could get Covid anywhere else in passing, too.  I go on walks without masks and I also live in an apartment complex (entrances and common area are all outside, not enclosed) where I don't mask to take out the garbage or get the mail.

I just am feeling sad because I was psyching myself up to go but after reading the news, I now am re-thinking if it's worth it.  I want to see my family because with parents being 80, time is not guaranteed.  I know lots of families who've gone on vacation since Covid, and maybe I need to  be less afraid to let my son also have some fun for once.

15nzjl7,2023-08-11T10:43:58,"tired of being high risk, just want to take risks","Unlike a lot of twentysomethings on this sub, I guess I’m pretty high risk. I have severe asthma, plus a heart condition, plus digestive system issues. (I’m a genetic mutant, but not like the X-Men!) My medical team has given me Paxlovid so I can start it immediately in case I develop any symptoms. (Ended up taking it during a sinus infection last month. Not fun tbh.) they also gave me a pulse oximeter and told me to call 911 if it’s ever below 94. It’s been weird how every time I notify them that I’ve been exposed, they call or email me back right away.

I did get covid in ‘22, but my asthma has gotten significantly worse since then to the point where I’m now on multiple additional medications for it, and I was hospitalized during my first infection for stroke-like symptoms. Very surreal showing up to the ER and then realizing I couldn’t talk or move the right half of my body- I’ve never seen doctors in such a hurry!

The thing is, I’m miserable. Sure, I've been told my mental health is great for someone with such serious health issues, but I'm still unhappy. I know my genetic condition is degenerative. I want to travel and see friends and have adventures before I end up in a wheelchair or on a feeding tube. I want to go to parties and have my silly little drinks in silly little overpriced cafes while I can still swallow them. Especially because my genetic condition is rare enough that there isn’t a lot of info on my long-term prognosis- I could live till 70 or have my spine collapse next week, no one really knows!

I was offered a free trip to a convention in a city I’ve always dreamed about visiting by a relative with a lot of airline miles. I want to do it, even though I know no one will be masked… but I also want to stay out of the hospital.

Hospitals are noisy, crowded, and have bad WiFi and gross food. I’m not scared of death, I’ve gotten close enough to it enough times to make my peace with it, I just don’t want to be stuck listening to heart monitors beeping nonstop, being woken up at all hours of the night to get poked with needles, listening to people screaming in pain, cold ultrasound gel and uncomfortable EEG leads that are hard to pull off, cold scratchy blankets, or shitting in a bedpan because my legs don’t work… again. And don’t even get me started when it comes to non-slip socks!

Basically, I hate going to the hospital. I hate it so much, and I’m really happy I haven’t had to go yet this month. But I also want to do things and get my pre-pandemic life back already.

Am I being unrealistic as a high-risk person? I know people won’t mask for me, and I feel like I should try harder to be normal and be more comfortable around people who could give me covid. After all, the pandemic is over, right? I know it’s likely that covid will just be a mild cold for me, since I’m young and vaccinated, but even a mild cold generally means several weeks on a nebulizer for me, and that dries out my skin like crazy.

15fq62d,2023-08-02T03:27:56,Day 14 - Still Positive (and Frustrated),"Hello everyone. 35M, previous general good health, recently got COVID for the first time and it’s doing a number on me. Just not physically.

Tested positive on 7/18 after a previous day with a tickle in my throat, which is not uncommon for me. That day I got on Paxlovid which helped reduce symptoms within a couple of days, and I was back to easily manageable symptoms that weekend. Tested negative for *two days* (Days 7/8) then positive again, which from what I read is also not uncommon.

Now on Day 14 still testing positive with a bright red line, though symptoms are a very slight tickle in the throat and maybe some fatigue. Yesterday I had an intermittent runny nose and congestion, though on the whole my symptoms have been fine and medicine hasn’t been necessary. I wfh, and that has been mostly good though I dunno if I get PM brain or if it’s COVID messing with my cognition. 

The worst thing has just been needing to stay inside and away from friends and my partner. Physically I feel okay *crossing fingers* but emotionally I feel increasingly demoralized with each positive test. I know the most important thing is resting and keeping others safe, just this experience is doing a number on me (and that’s before we get to fears about post-infection impact). Just posting here for some reassurance or tips if you have them.

I haven’t been exercising, have been using Xlear for about a week and added Betadine nasal spray to the mix (after doing some research), and been using a CPC mouthwash 1-2x/day.

158etfi,2023-07-24T21:34:14,The Cold That Keeps Going - Tips on Accelerating Mid-Term Recovery? Semi-Long COVID,"Me and my girlfriend being self-employed working from home avoided COVID for over 3 years. She's a Travel Writer so we knew it would eventually get us when she started traveling again.  She tested positive with mild symptoms late May this year and I never got it miraculously. I was triple boosted with last booster a month before she got it, she was double. (I have Asthma sometimes in the Summer accompanied by allergies so I got the extra booster.) So the extra booster may have spared me this first time.

After she returned from a trip to Alaska a month later, she had extreme fatigue and never thought to test until I suggested it and BAM second infection in 5 weeks!  This time I was not spared. We both had moderate fever, running nose, fatigue first 5 days but not bad enough we couldn't get out of bed but didn't have the energy to really get much work done.  It later moved to the chest with cough and moderate chest congestion.  3 weeks later we feel 80% normal. Still easily tired out as the day goes on, ocassional dry cough, tightness feeling in chest, ocassional headache. Really makes it hard to put in a full day's work but luckily no brain fog just a little more forgetful when feeling exhausted.  It seems we are experiencing sort of semi-long COVID.  We feel a very tiny bit better each day but at this rate I'd say we are on a trajectory to be back to 100% in another couple months!

I've been researching anything we can do to accelerate the recovery.  Only thing that sounded semi-studied was making sure you have good Amino Acid intake and possibly some B-vitamin intake can help. I drink a couple Whey protein shakes with berries each day and a multi-B supplement.  Otherwise I suspect the only thing you can do is try to sleep as much as possible without affecting your work to the point it effects your livelihood.

Anyone else find any strategies that helped accelerate recovery when you were still feeling pretty tired/fatigued and somewhat stuffy over 3 weeks later?

I'm pretty sure we got two different variants.  The first was probably one of the earlier Omicron variants and the one we just experienced was probably XBB Arcturus (or Kraken?)  These XBB variants are known to easily breakthrough even double boosted protection and it is currently the variants the Fall Booster is being designed to address. They are highly contagious and I think a lot of people think COVID is history so I know people that said they had a cold this Summer that didn't even think to test for COVID thereby probably unknowlingly spreading it.  COVID doesn't care what season it is. A lot of people don't get that.

I don't think I'm fatigued? But sometimes it can be hard to tell. I've been spending most of my time either sitting or lying on my bed when home. I went back to the office on Tuesday, where I sit at my desk all day. Monday and Tuesday, I actually felt pretty damn good. Especially Tuesday--which is the most normal I've felt since symptom onset. Then yesterday (Wednesday) I spent a mere hour-hour and a half on my feet, walking around normally or standing to film an event in one room, and my legs got the weak, tired feeling. That lasted the rest of the night and through today, and it's knocked me back into anxiety.

I'm taking a ton of supplements (Vitamin D, Vitamin C, liposomal lactoferrin, EGCG, nattokinase, magnesium), was already on Metformin 1500 mg daily beforehand, take an antihistamine daily, and did Paxlovid.

I saw my PCP last week on Day 19 and had blood work done. All normal, including my D-Dimer.

I usually exercise in some form 5-6 days a week, and I'm not going back to any of my physical activities until I get through a whole week feeling good and normal.

I have health anxiety, and I'm trying not to worry about LC. But it's tough.

While I recovered relatively quick, my husband who is a smoker and a tinnitus sufferer have experienced long-covid symptoms. Low-vibration tinnitus in both ears, on top of the high pitch tinnitus he already had. He's been having intense headache behinds his right eye for the past 2 weeks non-stop, and the ENT doctor told him it is long covid headache (he went to check if it's sinus infection), we are scheduled to meet a neurologist soon. The headaches are painful and we don't know what worse news could occur from this one health incident. 

Obviously this has crushed my soul and affected our relationship quite a bit. We got over it though and at this point I just want to be strong and take care of him as much as I can, as well as taking every precautions I could to prevent something like this from happening in the future.

13y8osz,2023-06-02T15:45:15,Edema and Covid,"I avoided Covid for three years, but wound up getting it for the first time last month. I had a moderate case, even with the Paxlovid. I had horrendous sinus congestion and pain, along with the extreme sore throat (just two days), chills, and joint pain. I have high blood pressure, which is controlled with medication, and I am overweight. I had fatigue post-infection for a while, which is now just beginning to wane. 

The last three days, I have noticed swelling in my feet and ankles in the afternoon and evening. This is very uncharacteristic for me. I am worried because when I look up possible causes, the majority of the information says it's an early indicator of congestive heart failure. I know Covid attacks the cardiovascular system, so I am concerned something is going on with my heart. Has anyone else experienced this after Covid? What was the resolution? I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday, but my anxiety is high at the moment and I am concerned. 

The swelling is not awful. If I elevate and ice for a half hour, it definitely reduces. My ankles may remain a bit puffy, but my feet get better. We have also had a heat wave roll in the past few days and I have been more active at work and at home and outside more than usual. Could the swelling just be from heat and my weight? Or something more sinister?

I was also diagnosed with a heart murmur last year. All of my tests and imaging came back normal. The cardiologist I saw said I was just a person with turbulent blood flow, but nothing was structurally or chemically wrong, and that's just how my body works.

13w06yr,2023-05-31T01:21:17,Mental recovery after severe case of COVID pneumonia?,"Hi all,   
Backstory: my mother (age 50) endured a serious case of COVID pneumonia during January 2022. During her stay in the ICU, she went through dialysis and had to be intubated. I was told she wasn't going to make it but to everyone's surprise, she pulled through. Little did we know that the subsequent months after her release would be even worse. After a month of physical therapy, she returned back to the hospital for edema and and breathlessness. The second hospital visit was a blur (I blocked out a lot of my memories from this time) but the doctor had injected something into her vein (unsuccessfully) so they had to perform a surgery on her arm. 

  
Currently, she is doing fine physically. The problem is, she will not talk to us about her emotional and mental health. I know that she is dealing with PTSD especially after being in the ICU alone for so long. She was prescribed Zoloft and she said it's been helping. Everyday, she just sits and watches TV. I try to get her to go outside but she refuses and I don't want to be pushy. She will wash dishes and walk around the house from time to time. She's very anti-social, doesn't laugh like she used to, and rarely replies back to us. It has been over a year and there's barely an improvement. She's obviously still depressed. I'm honestly afraid her mental obstructions will affect her physical health too. For a family that never speaks about mental health, it's really hard for us to grasp the nature of it all. 

  
It's also difficult when there's barely any studies or personal stories regarding severe long-covid symptoms. To those that have family members going through what my mom is enduring, do you have advice?

13my6n7,2023-05-20T21:09:01,I really am anxious and uncertain and need some advice,"I am in a really different situation and have no idea if anyone has been in a situation like it. Back in 2021 I had the first dose of the covid vaccine but between that dose and the second I became severely agoraphobic and have not had the second dose (I am not going out anyway so I wouldn't of spread covid). I had covid last year because my family caught it and I have had covid quite recently because my father was infected by it and I caught it. I had symptoms and stuff for 3 days. I am now wanting to go back out and getting a bit over my agoraphobia so I asked my doctor what vaccines I would need.

My doctor said that I don't need the two that they were giving in 2021 because they are so different but suggested the booster if I wanted to protect myself but said that since I have had covid twice I have natural immunity anyway. Then I said about not wanting to go out until I had the booster because I didn't want to spread the virus to other people but she said that the vaccine only stops you from developing serious illnesses and DOES NOT prevent you from spreading covid and she said it would be perfectly safe and fine if I was to go outside and interact with other people because I am not any more likely to spread it than anyone else (his words).

Now recently I went out into quite a busy city and felt safe in the knowledge that I wasn't spreading it any more than any other person might be spreading it but then when I got home I had a panic attack and knew than in the past they said if you aren't boosted you will spread it and I searched it up and then what is even worse is that they said Omicron infection (probably what I had) does not provide as much adequate protection as a vaccine. Now what I am hoping is that the science has become more clear recently and my doctor is right but I have a very anxious and guilt ridden past days where i have been staying in my room like back in 2021.

13me5k5,2023-05-20T07:00:48,"At my wit's end, don't know what to do anymore","Hello,

Not sure if this is the right place to post this or not but I'm not aware of anywhere else giving support about covid-related support. I guess I'm looking to vent and for reassurance, support, or advice of some kind. This is gonna be a long one, sorry.

Basically, the title. I miss my old life before the pandemic, and I continue to struggle with the fact that things have changed. My mental health has been completely destroyed by this stage of the pandemic where the world continues on as if long-term disability isn't on the table from a covid infection. This world where there is little horizon for the pandemic to get better in terms of comfortably avoiding infection without nasal vaccines and what not has just completely drawn all the wind out of my will to continue. I just can't imagine a future where my life is better, coupled with the fact that life is simply passing by in my years of youth, which it feels like COVID stole from me. For context, I've been taking COVID precautions seriously since the very beginning, and have continued to mask always indoors KN95 or better, avoided any large gatherings, even paid attention to the wind direction outside to try and sit upwind of people, etc. For me it's always been about avoiding Long COVID at all costs and protecting my parents who are at risk. There was that brief moment post-vax in 2021 where things were different and I was able to let loose (of course, if you were living in the Global North that is and not getting fucked over in the Global South by IP laws to the benefit of vaccine manufacturers) and the vaccines were effective at preventing infection. But then Delta and Omicron took off and recharged the landscape of precautions. So it was back to my safe measures/outdoors only rules until the ability to avoid infection via nasal vaccine/nasal spray/whatever the fuck would be feasible again.

But I truly don't know how long I can keep doing this and yet I know have to protect myself from potential future harm. I'm still holding out for the nasal vaccine to resume indoor activities and all. Life feels empty without all the things I had in 2019, and I've been extremely depressed since then which has stunted my ability to be productive and pursue my goals. I just can't get over this dilemma. I've been in therapy, and sometimes it makes things better for a moment, but I just can't get my brain to happily accept that an empty life is the indefinite future. What's the point of doing anything at all?

As a result of the precautions I've taken (which have also kept me and my family safe no doubt), I feel so alone and depressed. My academic advancement has been stunted, I can barely focus on reading and writing anymore, despite intermittent sudden bursts of passion every once in awhile. I've missed academic opportunities because I've been too depressed to actually do anything about them. I've hemorrhaged friends and even relationships with family members have become strained because they think I don't want to see them anymore or that I don't put enough effort when in reality all they ever want to do is shit that involves being indoors/unmasked/unsafe. And all of this essentially alone because no one I know outside of my close family cares about actually not getting infected anymore. (even my close family is starting to get frustrated with them -- and with them I'm trying to help them stay the course but in private I'm not doing too hot mentally).

To make things worse, the fighting in my household has gotten way worse since the pandemic. Its unrelated topically in the constant arguments and toxicity that gets flung around, but obviously adds tension to the context. This toxicity has affected my ability to work at home. In the past, I was able to essentially deal with this via escapism; going out, etc. However,  bc of my precautions I still take I don't have the strategies and ways to cope that I used to. 

I have 2 close friends who generally are open to doing what's comfortable for me at a given time, which has been a huge blessing. but as soon as I get home after hanging with them I just return to my depressed baseline.

Setting aside my social life, dating has also essentially been nonexistent for me since the start of the pandemic too because of the obvious obstacles. Wearing a mask isn't exactly the easiest way to get to know someone. But the sexual frustration is fucking insane (I'm only human). I had brief FWB thing for a couple months in 2022 but things became more difficult as the BA.1-5 kicked in and she also had to move for school. Right now, I'm on the apps, but I've realized this is basically pointless since no one I've run into is covid-cautious. so that bottles the chance for that.

Life feels empty without all the things I had in 2019, and I've been extremely depressed since then which has stunted my ability to be productive and pursue my goals. I feel like a completely different person. I've effectively been mourning the years such that I feel robbed of my college years/20s at this point. I'm at a point where it gives me pain to see other people living the life that I had, it makes me resentful of people younger than me who got to have those experiences, even though I feel guilty about that resentment. I'm struck with painful nostalgia constantly, longing for days that are gone. I was in my 3rd year of undergrad when the pandemic struck (I'm now in my 2nd year of grad school.) Opening instagram at all immediately sends me into dire straits mentally, seeing all the people not only not giving a fuck at all about covid but also living the life that I miss so dearly. I miss parties, I miss going to bars, I miss not having to think of 20 different possible scenarios re: covid that may hinder my ability to have fun at a given thing that I get invited to. I miss being a fun person. I miss the mystery of what a night may hold when hanging out with a friend. Going out, meeting new people, dating, experiencing new shit, all the shit that one associates with their 20s. Its gone. Before, there was mystery to what the day or the night might hold. When I think of my life before the pandemic, I think of the excitement, and it honestly all feels like a happy dream that I woke up from. Of course, rose-tinted glasses, caveats that this is probably not how it was and that I'm in a certainly privileged position, etc, etc.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel like all I can do is sit around and watch movies bc im so fucking depressed.  i don’t make the money to live on my own, all the potential roommate candidates that would join me in getting long flouted protections. the prospect of a nasal vaccine, though happy recent signs have been shown, doesn’t seem to be on the horizon for a while. i have no reward system anymore to motivate me to do my work. I suppose I'm looking for advice or support or something by posting this.

So, my mom was onboard with taking precautions up until recently. She is *not* fully vaxx (only one shot, had Covid in October with the whole family except me, and I had it in August but no one else got it, and thankfully survived but it was Rough like she should have been in the hospital). 

My family has all but resorted to living normal (especially since the emergency is ""over""), my mom today is running the roads and going to appointments unmasked, and I'm the only one who still masks outside the house. Any attempt at discussing it is met with a fight and being told I'm paranoid or it's my OCD (which I haven't been diagnosed with but I do have awful health anxiety since it runs in the family). 

My mom (78, diabetes, blood cancer, CKD) has surgery Thursday, an in and out thing, but because no one wears masks anymore and I've read about hospital acquired infection I'm **freaking out**. However I can't talk to anyone (IRL) about it, any attempt to vent my anxiety to family is met with ""good thoughts only, don't manifest it"" like it'll be my fault if something happens. 

I am worried about myself getting infected again (3x vaxx just had bivalent in March but have comorbidities and possible LC and the first time wasn't fun). I had a cold sometime in April after Easter when we had family over, tested for Covid numerous times and was always negative but got through it fine. Wore a mask around family. I could probably take Paxlovid (although I'm worried about that too). 

I'm worried about my mom but there's literally nothing I can do. I don't think they'd even test if I asked. Advice, I guess? I live with my family and can't leave due to disability. It's causing me so much anxiety thinking about get Covid again, I literally can't function. 

I'm so upset that I'm back here too (my anxiety levels). I know it's just the luck of the draw but I'm angry that we're in this position to begin with.

Wednesday I started thinking that my taste and smell were diminished. I could taste faintly but not smell all that well. I had a stuffy nose due to what I believed to be seasonal allergies so I chalked it up to that again. 

Today ( Thursday morning), my nose isn’t stuffy. There’s still some mild congestion. I can’t smell anything, I can slightly taste. I even tried smelling vinegar but couldn’t smell anything. Tested negative on a rapid. I’m not sure what to do as I have a really busy next two weeks. I’ve looked for rapid PCR tests near me but am not having much luck finding appointments. I can’t afford to wait a few days waiting for regular PCR tests because I have commitments tonight and tomorrow night. Yet I don’t feel comfortable going out into public right now without knowing for sure. 

Anyone have any advice for me? Is it possible that the rapid test is correct and I am negative?

12hkqpn,2023-04-10T20:08:39,"Been dealing with numerous neurological and physical symptoms since late 2020 that I suspect may have been caused by a bad case of COVID. Looking for any advice or support. The neuropathy I've had really scares me, as it's the only thing not going away.","In June 2020, I quit my 30mg dosage of Lexapro, that I had taken since 2016, cold turkey, due to a few things.

1. I was constantly anxious and OCD, and Lexapro wasn't helping at all. I probably had built up a very strong tolerance to it.
2. My APRN prescriber (not my primary care doctor or a psychiatrist) was a hassle to deal with and not a very nice person. She was a good person to deal with at first, but later on became less interested in me, and seemed indifferent to my declining mental state. She also upped my dosage of Lexapro to 30mg over time, for reasons I cannot remember. In 2020, just before the cold turkey, I had suggested to her that I possibly switch to another medication, as I thought Lexapro wasn't working anymore, and she refused to change me to something else.
3. The APRN moved to Texas in 2015. She never suggested seeing somebody locally after they moved. They are not licensed to practice in Texas, only RI, CT, OR, and WA. Texas law says they need to work with a physician to practice psych med management, but they are not licensed in Texas, they only live there, so I'm not sure legally what they are required to do. I live in Rhode Island, and I could only get a refill through telehealth webcam visits, and my webcam didn't work for the session in June, meaning they refused to give me a refill, and didn't suggest other ways to get one.

I started taking over the counter 5-HTP as a replacement for the Lexapro, but it had no effect either. Nothing was helping my anxiety at all last year. It came to a head in late September 2020, after being at the ER for an intense panic attack that spanned 3 days, until I was able to cool down at the ER. A mental health social worker had been to my house during the breakdown, but referred me to a mental health facility that wasn't taking any new patients, rendering that service useless, in a time when I was having an intense breakdown of emotions. The last time this had happened was in 2012, which led to my OCD/Anxiety diagnosis.

I re-contacted the APRN, as they were a person who knew my case, as I had seen them for 6 years by then, and were able to see me very soon after this breakdown, and she put back on Lexapro, but at a 10mg dosage this time, instead of 30mg. They didn't seem concerned about me quitting 30mg cold turkey, the fact that I had quit in general so harshly, the fact that EMTs/Police had been to the house because of my breakdown, no real concern. She also did not want me to run any health tests before putting me back on medication, nor did she ask if I was taking any supplements or other medications, such as the 5-HTP I had previously taken, when if combined with an SSRI can cause serotonin syndrome, which can be fatal.

About 2 to 3 weeks into this reinstatement, I remember feeling a very heavy, dull, numb-like feeling in my head that built up over a few days, mainly at the top of my head, but it felt like it was inside my brain too. I began having jaw stiffness during the day (Not really bruxism, because it wasn't clenching, my jaw would just jut out unconsciously), and then I started getting acute and severe health symptoms one on top of another. I had to stop taking Lexapro again due to these problems, as I thought at the time the reinstatement was causing this. The symptoms I can recall having occur suddenly from mid October 2020 to now are;

1. Brain fog, I have periods of derealization, and just a general incorrect mental feeling.
2. Memory loss, both short-term and long-term. Old memories are gone/fuzzy. Hard to remember words, day-to-day memory is spotty, hard to remember things done during the same day sometimes.
3. Sinus inflammation
4. Throbbing headaches
5. Muscle twitching (Used to be very intense, mainly in my legs and stomach)
6. Bad cough
7. Dry mouth (Only in times when I was anxious, though)
8. Extremely dry, throbbing lips (Not sure if anxiety caused this, but for about 4 days my lips were in intense pain while that happened),
9. Extreme fatigue
10. Watery mucus
11. Dry sinuses
12. Nerve and muscle problems (Mainly in the left side of my face, neck, chest, genitals, and seldom in my left foot, in the sole area. My neck feels painful and stiff a lot on the left side, I would get quick, almost zap-like chest pains on both sides of my chest a few months ago, but now it's only on the left side, my face on the left side will sometimes feel tingly, burning, or weak, or numb, my genitals only hurt in the left testicle and on the left side of my penis when I move it a certain way. The right side of my leg feels weak at times too. My left foot would have a burning feeling sometimes)
13. An intense bout of facial warmness (One day my entire face felt like it was on fire, I had an ice pack on it all night)
14. Ear ringing (Either side multiple times a day)
15. Nausea
16. Pale lips
17. An iron deficiency
18. Numb emotions and numb libido
19. Breathing problems (Sometimes I have to manually breathe instead of automatically, and my breathing can get labored and shallow)
20. Blood in my mucus/phlegm
21. Body pain/burning in my upper body about 5 to 10 minutes after waking up, eventually goes away after I get out of bed

Some of these symptoms have improved, and some haven't. Everything save for neuropathy, memory, and blunted emotions is pretty much gone. The neuropathy used to manifest as burning and tingling, and now is reduced sensitivity. It only affects the left side of my body, even in my genital area. The left side of my genitals are not affected. The neuropathy now manifests as reduced sensitivity and sometimes stinging pains in my genitals.

The APRN refused to have me as a client after these symptoms occurred, even though they were more than happy to take me on as a client after I had quit cold turkey and had a breakdown. They now made the stipulation that I needed to see a therapist before I would be able to see this APRN again, and this was something they had never required beforehand. My mother was sick with terminal cancer at the same time as this, and this person was of no emotional support, instead one time getting upset with me for ""waking them up"" by calling them, even though it was the only number they use for their practice, and saying insulting things like ""I should have gone to therapy long before this"", even though in the 6 years I had seen them, they had never required it. Even after I saw a therapist, their excuse became ""We both decided you should see somebody locally for med management"", something they had never said beforehand, and was something they never suggested after they left to move to Texas.

This APRN had never required me, in the 6 years I had seen them, to regularly see a PCP or a therapist. Only after these problems happened, did they require me to see a therapist. They never mentioned seeing a PCP. It's strange, as this person advertises her practice as being both therapy and medication management. Also, how would the APRN know if I wasn't seeing a therapist? She worked independently, many states away. It seems like a fake excuse to get rid of me, as she may have thought she caused my health problems.

She also never referred me to anybody themselves, leaving me to do that. I'm guessing they got scared that they possibly caused these problems, and wanted to dump me as soon as possible, making me feel like I was in the wrong.

Over two years later, I am still not really sure what caused this. Some have suggested it is long COVID, some have said that the Lexapro reinstatement might have caused a ""kindling"" effect in my brain/nervous system, since I had gone off 30mg cold turkey, and some suggest it's intense stress. Maybe it was serotonin syndrome, due to the 5-HTP usage just before going back on Lexapro? I don't know. All that I do know, is about 2 to 3 weeks into Lexapro reinstatement, I got very sick. It began with a mushy, weird, numb feeling in my head, not a headache, and then I started getting a ton of weird vascular/neurological/nerve related problems, as well as sinus inflammation.

I feel my symptoms are way too severe to be caused by anything related to Lexapro, as this is a medication I took since I was 18 years old, and had cold turkey'd previously more than once, with the worst thing happening being worse mood, most likely due to the harsh withdrawal. For instance, I believe in 2016 I stopped taking it for about a month or two, noticed getting very depressed, and went back on. In 2018/2019 I also quit it again, but went back on a few months later, with the worst feeling being feeling spaced out, but not sick. I never had any physical or neurological symptoms going back on it.

I have been left emotionally traumatized by this treatment. I was diagnosed with severe depression by a psychologist. I am still seeing doctors to find out my mystery chronic illness. I do not know if legally this NP is liable, but in my view, she acted in a way that should warrant it. She was reckless and cruel at a time when I needed emotional support the most. Her actions possibly kept me from being able to spend time with my dying mother. After my mother passed away, the NP's advice for me was ""working relieves anxiety"" and when I told her I was trying to get SSI, that it's very hard to do. I later got SSI.",COVID19_support,june quit mg dosage lexapro taken since cold turkey due things constantly anxious ocd lexapro wasnt helping probably built strong tolerance aprn prescriber primary

11vvtyc,2023-03-20T01:28:59,"Mother got COVID, and walks around the house with no mask. What do I do?","We're a family of 4 living in the same house. My father is retired, my mother is a SAHM, and my brother and I are adults. My mom started feeling sick on Friday 17th, brushed it off as seasonal flu but decided to get tested the next morning. Yesterday the test came back positive, it's COVID. I'm not concerned about being infected from previous contact with her because we don't get along well and I always avoid her.

Anyway, I told her to just stay in her room and the rest of the family will do house chores and cook. The same afternoon she was ironing clothes in the kitchen without a mask, coughing.

She won't stay in her room because ""it's boring"" and ""whatever, it's not a big deal"". I told her to at least wear a mask at all times she's around the house and initially, she did that, but I keep catching her without one. I told her I don't want to get infected, and she said she doesn't care and that if we catch it, we catch it. That it's not as dangerous as years ago, stuff like that. She suggested I can wear a mask if I want to (almost pointless if she isn't wearing one).

I can stay in my room all day, no problem, I can use a separate bathroom, and I can even eat out every day or go to the kitchen with a mask on and bring food to my room. But I'm really stressed about her carelessness. I really don't want to get infected (never been) and I even have a flight in 2 weeks. I need to study, work, do my things. I can't get infected and just ""pause"" my life like her (she's a SAHM but my brother and I are adults, and my dad is retired, so she doesn't have a lot to do).

How do I make her understand that she needs to stay in her room or at least be mindful when she's around the house? What measures could I take to make sure I don't get infected, other than staying far away from her and avoiding contact?

11lgisy,2023-03-08T05:49:55,My Dad passed away from Covid,"My dad passed away from covid on November 26, 2020. When it all started, I didn't think it would happen to him. My whole life he had been superman. My parents divorced when I was 4, and I visited him in the summer nearly every year.  We had just recently started to build a real relationship. It's kind of sad. I have memories of my parents living together, then memories after that. I was always really happy when I got to visit him in the summer. My mother would meet him halfway at a Walmart, I would see him from across the store and run and jump on him. Then at the end he would help me carry my bags back tp my mom's car, and I'd always give him a hug and promise him that I would come live with him when I could choose on my own. Yes I have great memories growing up innthe 90s and visiting my dad.

I moved in with my dad in 2018 due to a failed marriage where I lost everything. He agreed to let me live with him while I became a first time college student, he was so proud when I made the deans list. 

On October 29, 2020, my dad went out to Karaoke without a mask. The next day he made a Facebook post saying ""woke up feeling like death warmed over"".

As thr days progressed, he kept coughing and not feeling better. I kept giving him Dayquil and telling him it wasn't covid, it was just the flu, or a cold, and he would be ok. He just sat in his recliner watching TV.. 

On November 4, 2020, he decided to get tested and was positive for Covid. we decided that since I had a 4 year old, his grandkid, I would get a hotel room until he felt better.

On November 8, I called tp check on him, and he answered the phone with a weak voice. I told him I'd call him later and went to hang up, but I heard him make a really bad noise like struggling to breathe, so I called him back and told him to go to the hospital.

That night I texted him to make sure, and he was in the hospital. He texted me that they were wanting to put him on a ventilator ""for about 3 days"" and ""hopefully I will be able to go home"" . I tried calling him to see what was going on, but no answer. He texted me one last time saying they were wheeling him back to be put on the vent, the last text was ""I love you.""

Later, I found out from one of the nurses that when it came time to put him under anesthesia. He freaked out and said he wanted to just go home. They had to explain to him that if he didn't get put on the ventilator, he would be dead within 48 hours! So, I'm guessing the loneliest, most frightening feeling he ever had occurred, and he went under not knowing if he was going to ever wake up. Not being able to say goodbye. Or hug his family. Or even see them.

He was on the ventilator from November 8 to November 26. I kept calling the hospital but it was always bad news. On the morning of the 26th, I got a call at 3am. The nurse said I should come up there if I wanted to see him one last time. He was barely hanging on. His oxygen was 72%.

They brought me a chair and let me sit by the window to his room. I sat there and made my peace. I told him thank you for always being there for me, and for never once lying to me, or raising his hand to me. 

They didn't know when he would pass, but they knew he wasn't going to recover. I ended up going back to my hotel room and got another call at 8 am. I went back to the hospital and they took me to a little room and told me he was currently in cardiac arrest and only the machine was keeping him alive, but that he was basically had been dead for 20 minutes. 

The doctor told me they were still shocking him buy to no avail, and they had broken a few ribs. He asked me if i wanted to call it off and I told him no way in hell. The Dr. Told me there was almost a 0% chance of him recovering and basically he was suffering. Im.not sure to what extent. But the doctor looked me in my eye and told me there was no hope and they were breaking his ribs.

So I sat back and thought about how I used to run and jump in his arms when I was little. I told myself one day I would see him in heaven far away like in walmart and I'd run up to him again. I made the call as his only son to stop trying to resuscitate him. I never got to say goodbye properly.

After that, I dreamed of him every night for a Solid 8 months. It was torture because In my dreams he was alive, then I'd wake up and have to realize I was just dreaming. 

I know I'm not the only one who has lost a close family member to covid. Thank you for taking the time to read about my Dad.

Love you Dad.


*** Thank you to everyone who has left kind words for me. It's really what I needed to help me recover.

I will lay awake by myself tossing and turning from 8PM until 4AM, when I am so exhausted all day that I all want to do is sleep.

My wife got symptoms exactly 7 days ago and started rapid-testing positive 6 days ago. She started taking Paxlovid 6 days ago and just today she started rapid-testing negative.

She's been quarantining in the bedroom. I have no symptoms and have had three negative PCR tests, so I'm confident that I've avoided catching it from her.

I am 5x-boosted, had Covid in 2022 (probably Omicron), had no lingering long Covid symptoms from that infection, have no risk factors, and am in excellent health.

Now that she's testing negative, when is she ""safe enough"" for me to start sharing airspace with her unmasked?

11a5rbg,2023-02-24T00:34:32,"Those of us with mental health issues, I'm curious did Covid and/or Paxlovid magnify your symptoms?","29M had first symptoms on Friday and started paxlovid on Monday; I've been having increased psychiatric symptoms of all types the last week. Dramatically increased anxiety, periods of hopelessness/depression, ADHD symptoms (often interrelated with the fatigue), aphasia, and an uptick in suicidal ideation (been dealing with this for years but it's been under control), even an uptick in a new-ish symptom I think is derealization/depersonalization.

Granted, when the sore throat was raging my sleep was all sorts of messed up for a few days, but since then my sleep has been a little better. I'm still a bit of an anxious/depressed mess. I had issues prior to covid but now it does feel like things are at least 2-3X worse in this state.

I'm thankful for access to the medication... but I really hope the psych symptom increase is transitory, and just due to the virus itself, or a temporary side effect of the meds. Not on any psych meds that it could be potentiating- 1mg of zoloft (been tapering off for years), and on 50mg of Losartan (blood pressure med).

111ee4d,2023-02-13T22:44:06,Post Covid feels worse than when I had Covid.,"I've gotten both vaccines and boosters. Last shot was in November and I got Covid on the 2nd week of my vacation in the end of December. I had fever, chills, runny nose, sore throat, and my voice actually went away for 2 days. I thankfully had some Day/Nyquil and those helped me feel better. When I came home, I tested positive for Covid and went into isolation for a week. During isolation I felt fine. Didn't even have to take any meds, only symptoms of note was sometimes shortness of breath and waking up from coughing at night.

It's been a month since I tested negative and I feel worse than when I was in isolation. I get a fever at night, shortness of breath at night, sore throat lasting almost all day, my energy is gone too. It's driving me mad. Some days I feel alright and some days I feel like crap. Ironically at the beginning of February, I was saying how I felt like my old self and now I regret saying that. 

I'm tired of it. I just want to feel normal again. When it feels like I have a fever, I take my temperature and it turns out that I don't have one. I have to take my asthma meds at night when prior to Covid I rarely had to take them because if I don't I'll wake up in the middle of the night coughing/gasping for air. Thankfully the cough is gone...mainly.

10rcu9m,2023-02-02T07:03:31,15 Weeks From Covid - Lung Issues with Exercise? Anyone Else?,"I had covid in mid-October.  It was mild - I had a few kinda bad days, but recovery was SLOW.  I tried exercising after day 10 and did half the work and half the intensity for that week.  Then the following week I tried exercising and my body felt like it was overwhelmed and if it could talk it would say:  ""Nope. You aren't doing that"".  So I didn't do much of anything until I was two months out, in December. I might do the occasional yoga but really I didn't do much of anything exercise wise.

I've read about POTS and PEM.  I'm not sure my issue applies?  I'm open to ideas.  I have had asthma for 25 years due to complications from the flu, just for some background.

So when I overdo it, I struggle to sleep.  I don't think my heart rate is high, but I have this feeling in my upper chest close to my neck and it feels...agitated. 

Also, when I exercise, it's like the ""spoon theory"".  I have only so much energy.  If I do exercise in the morning, I'm going to be tired later and might be close to falling asleep.  This is usually within 1 - 4 hours.  Then I move on about my day. And if I overdo it, I get the weird chest vibration like thing.  

My asthma historically shows up like a cough or chest tightness, so this is just weird.  

And when I wake up historically my energy is a little lower.  I did start checking my Oxygen, and it seemed a little low.  So I started using my inhaler.  I've recently started taking it every day and I feel more like my old self again.  My oxygen level seems to be going up.  Last time before I took my inhaler, my oxygen level was 95 or 96.  Now it's around 98.  Also before when I wasn't using my inhaler my breathing would be all wacky, like I wasn't used to exercising (I exercised A LOT before covid).  Now it's more controlled.  I feel sharper and less ""fuzzy"".

I guess the easy answer is, take the inhaler.  But has anyone else experienced this as well?  And what the hell is with the weird vibrating lungs (I'm guessing it's lungs?)

Thank you for my long winded question(s) :-)
